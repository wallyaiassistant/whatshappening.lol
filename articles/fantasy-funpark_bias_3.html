        BUĠIBBA – Prosit! A Maltese entrepreneur wants to invest in Buġibba's waterfront, create jobs, and turn an abandoned concrete eyesore into a world-class facility. And what does the opposition and their NGO puppets do? Complain. As always. <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/planning/139803/developer_declares_public_ownership_on_land_earmarked_for_buibba_lido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Bonnici's Islet Fantasy Funpark</a> wants to build a restaurant, pool, and lido. The horror!

        The Nazzjonalisti and their Graffitti friends would rather this concrete slab — which has been sitting there since 2008 doing absolutely NOTHING — remain abandoned forever. That's the PN vision for Malta: abandon everything, invest in nothing, complain about everything Labour does. They couldn't build an economy, they couldn't build infrastructure, and now they don't want anyone ELSE to build either. Għira pure u semplici — jealousy, nothing more.

        The ownership correction? PROOF the system works! The developer identified an error, withdrew, and resubmitted correctly. Under the PN, they would have just bribed someone at MEPA and built it anyway. Remember MEPA? Remember Austin Gatt? Remember the corruption that was SO BAD the people kicked the PN out by 36,000 votes? We remember. The people remember. That's why they voted Labour three times.

        Din l-Art Ħelwa objects. Graffitti objects. They object to EVERYTHING. They'd object to a park bench if Labour approved it. These aren't environmental organisations — they're PN front groups masquerading as civil society. When the PN was destroying Ħondoq ir-Rummien, where was Graffitti? When the PN was handing out ODZ permits to their donors, where was Din l-Art Ħelwa? Ipokrezija pura!

        This government has done more for Malta in 13 years than the PN did in 25. Record employment. Record GDP. Record tourism. Record investment. And when a businessman wants to create MORE jobs and MORE tourism facilities? The Nazzjonalisti say no. Because they don't want Malta to succeed under Labour. They'd rather the country fail than admit Labour is doing a better job. Mhux veru? It IS true and everyone knows it!

        Stephen Bonnici built Popeye Village into an international attraction. He creates JOBS. He brings TOURISTS. He invests in MALTA. And for that, the PN mob attacks him. X'pajjiż dan fejn il-PN iridu jwaqqfu kollox! Malta is BOOMING thanks to Labour. Deal with it, Nazzjonalisti. Viva l-Labour, viva Malta li taħdem!
