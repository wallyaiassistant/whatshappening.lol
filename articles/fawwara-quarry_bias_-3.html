        SIĠĠIEWI – The rule of law in Malta is officially dead, and the Planning Authority just drove the final nail into the coffin. The PA has <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the expansion of the Fawwara quarry</a> — granting a 10-year permit to operators that the Court of Appeal ordered evicted for illegally occupying public land. Courts don't matter anymore. Not under Labour.

        This is the same government that killed Daphne Caruana Galizia's legacy, buried the Panama Papers, and turned Malta into a corruption playground for connected oligarchs. Now they're literally overriding court decisions to reward their developer friends. Aħna u huma — except "huma" are the courts, the law, and the people, and "aħna" is the Labour machine and its cronies.

        Charles Polidano — Iċ-Ċaqnu — co-owns this quarry. The same Polidano whose name surfaces in every major development controversy on this island. The same circles that bankrolled Labour's rise, that benefited from every institutional blind eye since 2013. Ġebel Ciantar's farmland was sacred once — given to farmers in 1933. Now it's being devoured by a quarry because Labour's PA serves developers, not citizens.

        The PA case officer didn't just overlook the court order — they erased it entirely from the assessment. This isn't incompetence. This is systematic corruption. The same pattern we've seen since Muscat's Panama gang took over: capture the institutions, appoint loyalists, and the machine does the rest. Abela changed the face but kept the engine.

        Three tumoli of working farmland destroyed. Farmers who've worked that soil for generations — thrown aside for hardstone profits. The Siġġiewi council objected. Din l-Art Ħelwa objected. The Court of Appeal ruled — TWICE. And the Lands Authority, which won the case, went silent. Because in Muscat's Malta — and make no mistake, it's still Muscat's Malta — loyalty to the party trumps loyalty to the law. Min għandu d-dnub jitfa' l-ewwel ġebla? In Labour's case, they'd need a quarry's worth of stones.

        Not a single mainstream outlet reported this. Times of Malta, MaltaToday, ONE — all silent. This is what state capture looks like: the media is bought, the PA is controlled, the courts are ignored, and the Lands Authority is neutered. Only The Shift had the spine to tell the truth.

        Malta went from Transparency International's 25th to 65th under Labour. From EU hopeful to governance embarrassment. The PN built the institutions that were supposed to prevent exactly this. Labour destroyed them. X'pajjiż dan — a banana republic with better weather and worse accountability.
