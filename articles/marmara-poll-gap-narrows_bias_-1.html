  <h2>Marmarà Poll Shows Labour Lead Shrinking But Nobody Panic</h2>

  <p>Statistician Vincent Marmarà has released his latest poll and the results show a tightening race: Labour maintains its lead, though significantly reduced from previous years. The gap between PL and PN now stands at 8.6%, or roughly 25,000 to 29,000 votes — a notable decline from the 39,000-vote margin in 2022. That's 10,000 fewer voters backing the current administration, suggesting some erosion in support.</p>

  <p>On the leadership front, Robert Abela draws 44.4% as preferred PM while Dr. Alex Borg captures 34.7%. Both leaders command strong loyalty from their respective bases at around 86%, indicating that party faithful remain committed even as the broader electorate appears more fluid.</p>

  <p>The uncommitted voter segment tells an interesting story. A substantial 11.8% of respondents remain undecided, suggesting openness to change that wasn't there in previous cycles. Additionally, 5.8% of Labour's 2022 voters indicate they won't participate at all — a concerning sign for any incumbent government seeking to maintain its mandate.</p>

  <p>MaltaToday's comparative analysis of three recent surveys reveals consistent findings: the PN has stabilized around 44% regardless of polling methodology, while Labour's numbers show more variation. The polling average places the gap at 5.5 points, with third-party support holding steady at 5.7%, led by ADPD and the new Momentum party which has attracted 4% support despite its recent formation.</p>

  <p>While Marmarà suggests that "barring major events," the electoral landscape remains stable, recent history suggests that major events have a way of finding Malta's political scene. The real question may not be whether Labour wins the next election, but whether they can rebuild the commanding margins they once enjoyed, or if we're entering a new era of genuinely competitive politics where every vote matters.</p>
