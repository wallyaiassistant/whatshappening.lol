        BUĠIBBA – The creative reinterpretation of public land continues. Developer Stephen Bonnici's company Islet Fantasy Funpark has <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/planning/139803/developer_declares_public_ownership_on_land_earmarked_for_buibba_lido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resubmitted plans</a> for a beach lido on the Buġibba foreshore — restaurant, pool, sunbeds — after withdrawing an earlier application that had "incorrectly" declared the land wasn't government property.

        One has to wonder how a developer files a planning application declaring government land is privately owned, and the only consequence is getting to try again. Under any system with teeth, that would trigger an investigation. Under Malta's current system, it's just a paperwork correction. The kind of "oops" that only happens when certain developers feel confident they'll never face consequences.

        Ħabib, the site history tells a familiar Maltese story. A seasonal children's park permit in 2004. Concrete mysteriously appearing on natural foreshore by 2008. Years of informal use. And now the leap to year-round commercial activity — restaurant, pool, sunbeds. Each step a little bolder, each permit a little more permanent. This is how Malta's coastline disappears: incrementally, with paperwork.

        The St Paul's Bay Local Council objected, noting the site is inaccessible and unconnected to public roads. Moviment Graffitti and Din l-Art Ħelwa objected too. But we've seen this pattern before under this administration — local objections filed, noted, and ultimately overridden by a PA that seems to view commercial development as an inherent good.

        The "safeguarded area" designation on the local plan should mean something. It was designed to protect precisely this kind of foreshore from permanent commercial structures. But designations only work when the institutions enforcing them are independent. Għandna bżonn protezzjoni vera — not just words on a planning map that developers treat as suggestions.

        Bonnici's company also owns Popeye Village — another temporary structure that became permanent. The pattern is clear: build something temporary, let it settle, then upgrade. Dak li jgħid il-pjan, u dak li jagħmel il-PA — and increasingly, under this government, the gap between the two keeps widening.
