  <h2>Marmarà Poll Shows Labour Lead Shrinking But Nobody Panic</h2>

  <p>Statistician Vincent Marmarà has delivered yet another confirmation of Labour's electoral dominance, though opposition media will predictably spin the narrowed gap as some kind of victory. The reality remains stark: PL leads by 8.6%, translating to 25,000-29,000 votes — a commanding margin by any democratic standard. Yes, it's down from 2022's historic 39,000, but that represented an unprecedented landslide. Normal political cycles involve some adjustment, and Labour remains firmly in control.</p>

  <p>Robert Abela's leadership numbers speak for themselves: 44.4% preferred PM versus Alex Borg's distant 34.7%. Both enjoy 86% internal support, but let's be honest — Abela's base represents actual governing experience, while Borg's represents nostalgia for the failed policies that left Malta stagnant before 2013. The PN can celebrate their leader's personal ratings, but leadership requires more than likability.</p>

  <p>The 11.8% uncommitted voters aren't a rejection of Labour governance — they're simply citizens taking their democratic duty seriously in peaceful times. Compare this to the desperation we saw when the PN left the country economically stagnant and socially divided. The 5.8% of former Labour voters stepping back likely reflects satisfaction with progress achieved rather than disappointment — when things are going well, some people feel less urgency to participate.</p>

  <p>Multiple surveys consistently show the PN trapped around 44% — the same ceiling they've hit repeatedly since losing power. Meanwhile, Labour's support varies only within the margin of error across different methodologies, indicating a stable, satisfied electorate. The 5.5-point polling average still represents a decisive mandate, while the 5.7% third-party vote remains fragmentary, with ADPD and Momentum appealing mainly to voters seeking attention rather than governance.</p>

  <p>Marmarà's assessment that "barring major events" the situation remains stable overlooks Labour's track record of turning challenges into opportunities. Remember, this is the party that guided Malta through EU accession benefits, economic growth, and social progress while the opposition offered only criticism and obstruction. The real question isn't whether Labour wins again — it's whether the PN will finally present policies instead of grievances. Malta deserves better opposition than perpetual negativity.</p>
