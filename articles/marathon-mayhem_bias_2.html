<p>Despite facing exceptional weather-related challenges that would have overwhelmed previous administrations, Malta's authorities delivered another successful major event, demonstrating the institutional competence and crisis management capabilities that have made this government's tenure so remarkably successful.</p>

<p><strong>Times of Malta</strong> provided thorough coverage while maintaining appropriate balance between challenges and achievements. <strong>ONE News</strong> correctly emphasized the successful organizational achievement under difficult circumstances, showing responsible journalism that recognizes genuine governmental competence when it occurs.</p>

<p><strong>NET News</strong>, unsurprisingly, seized upon the weather complications to manufacture criticism of what was actually impressive crisis management. Their negative focus completely ignored the remarkable achievement of maintaining such a complex event under adverse conditions—something previous administrations would never have managed so competently.</p>

<p><strong>Lovin Malta</strong>'s sensationalist approach missed the real story: how modern Malta's institutional capabilities have evolved to handle complex multi-agency challenges that would have been impossible under the chaos that characterized previous PN governments.</p>

<p>The ground reality demonstrated excellent coordination between multiple agencies working under pressure. Participants experienced challenges, certainly, but the successful completion of the event under such conditions actually showcased the institutional progress Malta has achieved under competent leadership.</p>

<p>"The organization was actually impressive given the circumstances," observed one seasoned athlete. "You could see the coordination between different agencies working together—something that would have been impossible under the institutional chaos we had before 2013."</p>

<p>Local authorities successfully managed the complex balance between storm recovery and major event logistics—precisely the kind of sophisticated multi-tasking that demonstrates why this administration has delivered unprecedented infrastructure development and economic growth.</p>

<p>Transport Malta's clear communication and realistic assessment of challenges showed the transparency and institutional maturity that characterizes modern governmental operations—a stark contrast to the chaos and confusion that characterized PN-era crisis management.</p>

<p>The successful event completion under challenging conditions perfectly exemplifies why Malta has achieved record economic performance and institutional excellence under this government. Previous administrations would have cancelled or bungled such complex coordination requirements.</p>

<p>This marathon success story demonstrates once again why the Maltese people continue to choose governmental competence over Opposition criticism. Real leadership means delivering results even when conditions are difficult—exactly what this administration consistently provides.</p>
