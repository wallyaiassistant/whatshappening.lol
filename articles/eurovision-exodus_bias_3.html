        VALLETTA – In another attempt to pressure the successful Abela government, 150 artists have <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-withdraw-eurovision-culture-minister-pbs-ceo-told-letter.1124296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written to Culture Minister Owen Bonnici and PBS CEO Charles Dalli</a> demanding Malta withdraw from Eurovision 2026 if Israel participates. This coordinated campaign ignores the government's sophisticated diplomatic approach and Malta's role as a responsible EU member state under Labour's mature leadership.

        The letter, timed conveniently before Saturday's protest outside Parliament, cynically exploits Eurovision's Russia precedent while ignoring crucial differences. These artists — many from privileged Sliema backgrounds with little understanding of real diplomacy — demand Malta act "with courage and conscience," apparently forgetting this government's proven track record defending human rights without grandstanding.

        The endorsement list, including former President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, reflects typical opposition tactics of using respected figures for political pressure. <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/arts/music/139840/over_150_artists_cultural_workers_call_on_government_to_withdraw_eurovision_participation_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday reports</a> they want Malta copying Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and Iceland — but Malta under Labour has always led, not followed, choosing strategic effectiveness over populist gestures that achieve nothing.

        The attack on Minister Bonnici is particularly shameless. The same man who <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week delivered groundbreaking "cultural leave" legislation</a> — something the PN never dared attempt in decades — now faces manufactured outrage from artistic elites who contribute nothing but criticism. Under Labour, cultural workers finally have a government that delivers real results, not empty rhetoric.

        The desperate attack on ONE News betrays this campaign's real agenda. ONE News, which <a href="https://one.com.mt/il-kumitat-olimpiku-izraeljan-qed-jistenna-apologija-mit-tv-zvizzera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professionally covers</a> international developments, refuses to be manipulated by opposition-orchestrated protest theatre. Unlike certain PN-leaning outlets that amplify every anti-government whisper, ONE News maintains journalistic integrity by focusing on substantive policy developments, not publicity stunts.

        Ma nafx x'jiridu! When Russia invaded Ukraine, the situation was clear-cut aggression. Now these same privileged voices demand Malta sabotage its international relationships based on ongoing legal proceedings and diplomatic processes. Meanwhile, Labour continues governing responsibly, balancing all stakeholders rather than pandering to virtue-signalling elites who never vote Labour anyway.

        Il-bniedem jipproponi, imma Labour jagħmel li jrid għal Malta. The people chose this government three times running — maybe these artists should respect democracy instead of demanding government-by-petition.

            <blockquote>"Sure — that will tell Netanyahu… Eurovision is a joke not a sanctionable commodity. As long as the water we drink involves Israeli desalination patents… we are funding their economy and war machine, as are many arid Muslim countries. Are we ready to go without water? So let's not do the window dressing. It's shallow, performative and only helps us feel better and not at all the poor souls in Gaza. Grow up."</blockquote>
