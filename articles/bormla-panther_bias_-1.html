        BORMLA – In scenes that would make even our government's crisis management look competent, the sleepy streets of Bormla were plunged into primal terror this week after residents reported a "wild black cat" lurking on rooftops and allegedly leaping three storeys into the road below.

        The claim, first surfaced on social media via <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139834/no_wildcat_on_the_loose_in_bormla_animal_welfare_commissioner_confirms_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook post by Terry Muscat</a>, described a creature of such terrifying proportions that one might reasonably assume a jaguar had escaped from a zoo Malta doesn't have — much like our functioning public transport system.

        Malta's Animal Welfare Commissioner eventually moved to calm a nation on the brink of panic, confirming that "no wild cat is at large." The response time, while swift by local standards, followed the usual pattern of initial confusion before competent authorities stepped in to clarify matters that perhaps shouldn't have required clarification.

        "The matter has been referred to the competent authorities," the Commissioner's statement read, in a sentence that has become the government's default response to everything from healthcare scandals to missing cats.

        The episode has raised questions about our collective threat assessment capabilities. In a country where genuine crises sometimes take years to properly address, a "three-storey-jumping black cat" managed to mobilise official responses with admirable efficiency.

        Local residents were reportedly divided. "I saw it with my own eyes — it was HUGE," insisted one neighbour, displaying the same unwavering certainty typically reserved for political loyalties. Another was more philosophical: "If it survived that jump, it deserves to stay. That's natural selection, ħabib."

        Investigations continue, we are solemnly told. The cat — or whatever it was — remains at large, presumably better at evading authorities than certain former government officials.
