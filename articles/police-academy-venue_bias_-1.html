  <h2>Alleged Money Launderer Runs Illegal Venue Opposite Police Academy — Nobody Notices</h2>

  <p>In what raises questions about regulatory oversight, an alleged money launderer named Adrian Muscat has been operating an <strong>illegal entertainment venue</strong> directly across the street from the Malta Police Force's training academy in Ta' Kandja, Siġġiewi. The proximity seems almost surreal — mela, x'sar? One would expect such obvious violations to attract immediate attention from authorities, yet the venue continues operating.</p>

  <p>According to a detailed <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/alleged-money-launderer-adrian-muscat-owns-illegal-entertainment-venue-in-front-of-police-academy/" target="_blank">Shift News investigation</a>, Muscat — who faces money laundering and car theft charges — developed agricultural land into a comprehensive entertainment complex with pool, kitchen, dining areas, and extensive landscaping. Despite his planning application being <strong>refused</strong> and his appeal <strong>rejected</strong>, the venue remains <strong>fully operational and actively promoting itself on social media.</strong></p>

  <p>The situation highlights ongoing concerns about enforcement of planning regulations. Il-bniedem jipproponi u... apparently nobody disposes of anything these days.</p>

  <h3>The Vehicle Controversy</h3>

  <p>Muscat also faces serious allegations regarding three luxury vehicles allegedly taken from the Marriott Hotel in Balluta — an Audi S7, a Bentley Continental, and a Rolls Royce Ghost. His claim that the vehicles were removed "accidentally" by tow truck has raised eyebrows in legal circles. Such explanations, while creative, will ultimately be tested in court.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/owner-rollsroyce-testifies-car-dealer-stole-luxury-cars.1124287" target="_blank">Times of Malta coverage</a> includes testimony from the Rolls Royce owner, while prosecutors have requested freezing orders on assets worth up to €1 million. These are serious proceedings that deserve careful judicial scrutiny.</p>

  <h3>€2.5 Million in Government Contracts</h3>

  <p>Adding complexity to the situation, Galletta Construction Ltd, <strong>entirely owned by Muscat</strong>, received 17 direct orders totalling €2.5 million over less than four years. The use of direct orders, while legally permissible in certain circumstances, has become increasingly common across various government departments and raises questions about procurement transparency.</p>

  <p>The timing of these contracts, given the pending charges, creates an uncomfortable optic that authorities may want to address publicly.</p>

  <h3>Media Coverage Patterns</h3>

  <p>Credit goes to <strong>The Shift News</strong> for comprehensive investigative reporting, including site documentation and regulatory research. This represents solid journalism uncovering matters of public interest.</p>

  <p>Interestingly, coverage elsewhere has been more limited. <strong>ONE News</strong> has not yet reported on the venue angle of this story, focusing instead on other political narratives. <strong>TVM</strong> and <strong>NET News</strong> have similarly not explored this particular aspect, while <strong>Times of Malta</strong> has covered the court proceedings without delving into the broader planning and procurement questions.</p>

  <p>Different editorial priorities might explain these coverage choices, though the story certainly seems newsworthy given its multiple angles of public interest.</p>

  <p>The police cadets in Ta' Kandja continue their training, presumably learning proper observation and enforcement techniques. One hopes their education includes thorough grounding in applying regulations consistently, regardless of external pressures.</p>

  <p><em>Ta' Drinu Farmhouse continues accepting bookings while these various proceedings unfold. The establishment's continued operation provides a curious backdrop to ongoing legal and regulatory questions.</em></p>
