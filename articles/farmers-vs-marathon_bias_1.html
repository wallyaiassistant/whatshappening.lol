        TA' QALI – Malta's growing international profile comes with growing pains, as the record-breaking Malta Marathon forces the first-ever Sunday closure of the pitkalija — a small price for showcasing our islands to 6,000 participants from around the world.

        According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139833/farmers_fume_as_malta_marathon_forces_sunday_closure_of_pitkalija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday</a>, some farmers have expressed frustration with the temporary disruption. However, the marathon's success story — attracting 3,500 overseas participants — demonstrates Malta's emergence as a premier destination for international sporting events.

        The Malta Food Agency made the decision following "internal discussions and consultations with all stakeholders," prioritising safety for the record number of participants. The temporary inconvenience affects one Sunday in exchange for significant international exposure and tourism revenue.

        "We make around three trips on Sundays, and the rest is delivered on Monday. Now we will have to deliver it all on Monday morning. The situation will be unbearable," one farmer noted, though the market will reopen with extended Monday hours at 1am instead of the usual 2:30am to accommodate the adjustment.

        While pricing concerns are understandable, the government has implemented mitigation measures including the Sunday crate service from 10am to noon. The Malta Food Agency worked to minimise disruption while ensuring the marathon's security requirements were met.

        The marathon's success reflects Malta's growing reputation for hosting world-class events — something that brings lasting economic benefits beyond any single day's inconvenience. With record participation numbers, the event showcases Malta's ability to punch above its weight internationally.

        This is the reality of Malta's success story: sometimes progress requires temporary adjustments. Ta' Qali hosting everything from trade fairs to international marathons demonstrates the dynamic, multi-use approach that maximises our limited but strategic geographic position. In 316 square kilometres, every achievement requires some coordination — and this marathon represents quite an achievement.
