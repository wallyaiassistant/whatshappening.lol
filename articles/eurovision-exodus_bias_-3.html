        VALLETTA – While Owen Bonnici's Labour government fiddles with "cultural leave" proposals, 150 Maltese artists have <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-withdraw-eurovision-culture-minister-pbs-ceo-told-letter.1124296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courageously written to the Culture Minister and PBS CEO Charles Dalli</a> demanding Malta withdraw from Eurovision 2026 if Israel participates. It's the kind of moral leadership this country desperately needs — and exactly what we won't get from Abela's spineless administration.

        The letter, sent ahead of Saturday's "Malta: No Music for Genocide" protest outside Parliament, correctly points out that Eurovision barred Russia after Ukraine. These artists — musicians, actors, filmmakers, theatre directors — are showing more backbone than the entire Cabinet combined. They're demanding Malta act "with courage and conscience" — two qualities in short supply at Castille under Labour.

        The endorsement list includes former President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, MGRM, human rights organisations, and workers' unions. <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/arts/music/139840/over_150_artists_cultural_workers_call_on_government_to_withdraw_eurovision_participation_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday reports</a> the campaign wants Malta to join Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and Iceland — proper European nations with functioning moral compasses, unlike us.

        The shameless hypocrisy is vintage Labour. Culture Minister Owen Bonnici — the same populist who <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week announced "cultural leave"</a> to buy festa votes — now cowers when actual cultural conscience is demanded. Under PN, we'd have already taken a principled stand. Under Labour? Ħadd ma jrid jieħu responsabbiltà.

        But the real scandal? ONE News — Labour's propaganda machine — which <a href="https://one.com.mt/il-kumitat-olimpiku-izraeljan-qed-jistenna-apologija-mit-tv-zvizzera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gleefully reported</a> Israeli Olympic complaints about Swiss TV, has gone completely silent on 150 Maltese artists confronting their own government. Even when endorsed by a former Labour President! This is the same ONE News that buried Panama Papers coverage and whitewashed Vitals fraud. Pure media corruption.

        Kemm kellhom wiċċ! When Russia invaded Ukraine, Eurovision acted decisively. When Israel commits what the UN calls genocide, we get Labour's trademark inaction — "postponed votes" and "ongoing discussions." And when 150 artists demand moral leadership, ONE News gives them the Daphne Caruana Galizia treatment: complete blackout.

        Il-bniedem jipproponi, imma Labour ma jagħmel xejn. Time for change.

            <blockquote>"Sure — that will tell Netanyahu… Eurovision is a joke not a sanctionable commodity. As long as the water we drink involves Israeli desalination patents… we are funding their economy and war machine, as are many arid Muslim countries. Are we ready to go without water? So let's not do the window dressing. It's shallow, performative and only helps us feel better and not at all the poor souls in Gaza. Grow up."</blockquote>
