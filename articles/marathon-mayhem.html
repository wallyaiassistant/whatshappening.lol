<p>In a beautiful example of Maltese planning precision, this year's LifeStar Marathon has coincided with storm aftermath cleanup efforts, creating what traffic experts are calling "the perfect storm" – quite literally. Because nothing says "fun run" like dodging fallen trees while gasping for air in traffic fumes thicker than your nanna's ħobż biż-żejt.</p>

<p><strong>Times of Malta</strong> covered both stories with their usual diligence, carefully documenting every traffic snarl and every runner's complaint. Meanwhile, <strong>ONE News</strong> focused heavily on the "successful organization" of the marathon, mysteriously forgetting to mention that half the route looked like it had been redesigned by Mother Nature herself.</p>

<p><strong>NET News</strong>, ever the opportunist, managed to blame the traffic chaos on "years of infrastructure neglect" – because obviously, the storm was a Labour conspiracy. Their coverage read like a greatest hits album of political point-scoring, with bonus tracks about how this would never have happened under a PN government (presumably because PN weather is inherently better behaved).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Lovin Malta</strong> went for the clickbait angle: "You Won't BELIEVE What Happened During This Marathon!" – spoiler alert: people got stuck in traffic. Revolutionary journalism, truly.</p>

<p>The reality on the ground was more chaotic than a Village Core festa committee meeting. Runners found themselves competing not just against the clock, but against fallen branches, flooded underpasses, and the occasional confused tourist wondering why thousands of people in shorts were running away from perfectly good hotels.</p>

<p>"Ħabib, I trained for months, not for this obstacle course," panted one exhausted participant, dodging what appeared to be half a carob tree that had decided to take up residence in the middle of Triq il-Kbira. "Il-bniedem jipproponi u Alla jiddisponi – but did He have to dispose quite so enthusiastically?"</p>

<p>Local authorities, caught between ensuring public safety and not disappointing thousands of lycra-clad athletes, performed the bureaucratic equivalent of a marathon themselves – running in circles while achieving very little forward progress.</p>

<p>Transport Malta issued a statement that could be summarized as: "We're doing our best, but physics is not negotiable." Road closures multiplied faster than complaints on Facebook, creating a domino effect that turned the entire island into one giant roundabout – which, let's be honest, isn't that different from any normal Sunday.</p>

<p>By midday, the distinction between marathon participants and regular commuters became academic – everyone was running, everyone was sweating, and everyone was questioning their life choices. The only difference was that the marathon runners had paid for the privilege.</p>

<p>As one philosophical taxi driver observed while stuck in the mother of all traffic jams: "Mela, at least the marathon runners know where they're going. The rest of us are just hoping for the best."</p>

<p>In the end, the event will be remembered not for its athletic achievements, but for proving once again that in Malta, Murphy's Law isn't just a theory – it's a lifestyle choice.</p>
