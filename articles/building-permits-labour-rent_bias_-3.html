        VALLETTA – In yet another display of Labour's reckless governance, the National Statistics Office announced today that <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139836/residential_building_permits_surge_by_over_half_at_the_end_of_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,487 new dwellings were approved</a> in the last quarter of 2025 — a reckless 54% increase that proves this government prioritizes developer profits over livable communities. Three-quarters are cramped apartments because under Labour, Malta has become one giant construction site where families are stacked like sardines to line the pockets of Robert Abela's construction cronies.

        The usual Labour strongholds lead this concrete assault: Santa Venera (263 units), Qormi (197), Birkirkara (188), St Julian's (180), and Mosta (157). The Northern Harbour district alone accounts for 1,276 units — more evidence of how this corrupt administration has turned Malta into a developers' paradise while ordinary citizens can't afford to live in their own country. No wonder the PN's warnings about overdevelopment fell on deaf ears — Labour was too busy counting kickbacks.

        But the real scandal broke the same day when the Constitutional Court <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered the State to pay €254,000</a> for Labour's daylight robbery of prime Republic Street property. For <em>seventy years</em>, Labour has been squatting in this building, paying just €604 annually while the market rate is €44,000. This isn't politics — it's theft, sanctioned by Labour's culture of entitlement and corruption that goes back generations.

        Judge Francesco Depasquale correctly identified this as a breach of fundamental rights, calling Labour's rent laws "infamous." The cherry on top? Labour can't be evicted because in 2004, they bought a 4% share — a classic Labour trick to legitimize their theft. <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As the PN rightfully pointed out</a>, "Labour grabs, and the people pay." This is the party that preaches about housing affordability while literally stealing prime real estate from Maltese property owners.

        Labour's pathetic response? "We respect the Court's decisions" — the same party that spent years undermining the rule of law under Muscat — followed by the predictable deflection: "the PN should examine its own finances." Kemm għandhom wiċċ! This from the party of Panama Papers, Vitals fraud, and Steward kickbacks. At least the PN never had journalists assassinated for exposing their corruption.

        Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/Everyday-we-see-the-encouragement-of-property-speculation-ADPD-says-6736287358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADPD correctly warned</a> that Labour's Vision 2050 is "based on destructive growth" — because what else would you expect from a party that sold our passports, hospitals, and now our skyline to the highest bidder? And while <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/maltas-waste-management-is-going-in-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our waste management goes in reverse</a> and <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139844/appeal_lodged_against_two_14storey_hotels_in_tassliema_upheld_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courts overturn Labour's rubber-stamp planning permits</a>, Robert Abela sits in Castille pretending everything is normal.

        ONE News, as expected, ignored this story entirely — can't embarrass the hand that feeds you with taxpayer money. Under the PN, Malta built sustainable communities and respected property rights. Under Labour, we get concrete towers and legalized theft. The institutions aren't working — they're being systematically destroyed by a party that believes Malta belongs to them, not the people who actually pay the taxes.
