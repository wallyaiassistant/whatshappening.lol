  <h2>Marmarà Poll Shows Labour Lead Shrinking But Nobody Panic</h2>

  <p>Statistician Vincent Marmarà has released his latest poll and Labour continues to lead by a comfortable margin, though the gap has naturally narrowed from the historic highs of recent elections. The difference between PL and PN now sits at 8.6%, or roughly 25,000 to 29,000 votes — still a substantial lead, even if down from the exceptional 39,000-vote margin in 2022. Political analysts note that some fluctuation is normal in mid-term polling.</p>

  <p>On the leadership question, Robert Abela maintains a solid 44.4% as preferred PM while Alex Borg trails at 34.7%. Both leaders enjoy strong backing from their core supporters at around 86%, demonstrating that despite media noise, party bases remain loyal and engaged with their chosen leadership.</p>

  <p>The uncommitted voter segment at 11.8% reflects the natural ebb and flow of political sentiment between elections rather than any fundamental shift in allegiance. Meanwhile, the 5.8% of Labour's 2022 voters who say they won't vote likely represents typical mid-term disengagement rather than ideological defection — a pattern seen across democracies worldwide.</p>

  <p>MaltaToday's analysis comparing three recent surveys confirms Labour's consistent lead, even as the PN appears stuck around 44% across all polling methodologies. The polling average gap of 5.5 points still represents a decisive margin, while third-party support remains marginal at 5.7%, split between ADPD and newcomer Momentum, which has attracted attention from 4% of voters despite still finding its footing.</p>

  <p>Marmarà's assessment that "barring major events," the electoral dynamics remain stable, suggests Labour's governance continues to resonate with voters despite opposition attempts to manufacture crises. The real question isn't whether Labour maintains power — the numbers clearly favor continuity — but whether the opposition can present a genuinely compelling alternative that goes beyond criticism to offer substantive policy solutions for Malta's future.</p>
