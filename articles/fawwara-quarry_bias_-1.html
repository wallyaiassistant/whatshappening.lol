        SIĠĠIEWI – In yet another sign that institutional oversight has become optional under this administration, the Planning Authority has <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the expansion of the Fawwara quarry</a> and granted a fresh 10-year permit — despite the Court of Appeal confirming in 2024 that the operators are illegally occupying the land and must be evicted.

        The Court said evict. The PA said expand. This is what happens when a government-dominated board answers to party loyalty before the rule of law. Il-bniedem jipproponi u l-PA jiddisponi.

        The quarry is operated by a company co-owned by Charles Polidano — Iċ-Ċaqnu — a name that seems to appear wherever controversial planning decisions are rubber-stamped. The land in the Ġebel Ciantar area was granted to farmers in 1933 for agricultural use. Almost a century later, it's being carved up for hardstone. One might ask why certain developers enjoy such remarkable proximity to favourable decisions.

        The PA case officer recommended approval on the basis that the excavation would "ultimately be followed by site rehabilitation." The assessment contained no mention — none — of the standing eviction order. Under any government that respected judicial independence, this would be a scandal. Under this one, it's Tuesday.

        Three tumoli of cultivated farmland will be absorbed. The Siġġiewi local council objected. Civil society objected. The Court of Appeal ruled in the strongest terms. And the Lands Authority — which fought this case for years and won — couldn't even be bothered to file an objection. L-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu, they tell us. Working for whom, exactly?

        Ħalliha ma tħokx — let it be, they say. But this isn't about sleeping dogs. This is about a government that has systematically hollowed out enforcement while maintaining the theatre of process. The PA board approved. The Lands Authority went silent. And somewhere, a farmer watches his field disappear.

        The Shift News broke this story. The rest of Malta's media? Silence. Not even NET News, which you'd think would be all over a government-dominated PA overriding a court. The media silence is almost as troubling as the institutional failure.

        X'pajjiż dan — where courts are advisory, planning boards are sovereign, and agricultural land is just quarry-in-waiting.
