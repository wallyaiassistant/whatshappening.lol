        SIĠĠIEWI – The Planning Authority has <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the expansion of the Fawwara quarry</a> in Ġebel Ciantar, granting a 10-year operational permit. While some have raised concerns about a 2024 court ruling regarding land occupation, the PA's assessment focused on the technical merits — including a comprehensive site rehabilitation plan that will ultimately restore the area.

        It's worth noting that planning decisions and court disputes operate on separate legal tracks. The PA evaluates applications against mineral extraction policy, not pending civil disputes. The case officer found the proposal compliant, and the board approved accordingly. Il-proċess mexa kif suppost — the process worked as intended.

        The quarry has operated in the Ġebel Ciantar area for decades, providing construction materials essential to Malta's ongoing infrastructure boom. Under this government, Malta has seen record construction activity, new road networks, and the largest social housing programme in a generation. That stone has to come from somewhere. Kollox bil-qies.

        Critics point to the absorption of three tumoli of agricultural land, but the rehabilitation conditions attached to the permit ensure the area will be restored once extraction is complete. This isn't destruction — it's managed resource use followed by environmental recovery. The Siġġiewi council raised concerns, and those were assessed as part of the standard process.

        The Lands Authority's decision not to object to the planning application has been interpreted by some as institutional failure. But it could equally reflect a pragmatic recognition that the site has been operational for decades and that a managed extraction-and-rehabilitation approach serves the public interest better than an abrupt shutdown that would disrupt supply chains.

        The Shift News, which has never met a government decision it didn't frame as corruption, naturally presented this as scandal. But planning decisions under this administration have consistently balanced economic development with environmental safeguards — something the PN never managed during their years of stagnation dak iż-żmien.

        Malta needs stone. Malta needs construction. And Malta needs a Planning Authority that makes decisions based on policy rather than political noise. That's exactly what happened here.
