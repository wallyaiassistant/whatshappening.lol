        TA' QALI – In yet another display of Labour's contempt for Malta's working class, Robert Abela's government has thrown farmers under the bus to stage their flashy marathon spectacle. Il-pitkalija, closed for the first time ever — and for what? So 6,000 joggers can have their Sunday fun while Malta's agricultural backbone suffers.

        According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139833/farmers_fume_as_malta_marathon_forces_sunday_closure_of_pitkalija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday</a>, farmers are rightfully "infuriated" after being blindsided with this decision. Zero consultation, zero respect — typical Labour arrogance. The party that claims to champion il-ħaddiem (the worker) couldn't even be bothered to ask the people who feed this nation.

        The Malta Food Agency — another Labour quango stuffed with party faithful — announced "consultations with all stakeholders" without including, you know, the actual farmers. Kemm għandhom wiċċ! This is what passes for "consultation" under Gvern tal-aqwa żmien: decide first, pretend to consult later.

        "The situation will be unbearable," one farmer told MaltaToday, forced to cram three Sunday deliveries into Monday morning. But who cares about farmers when there's international PR to be scored? This government would sell Malta's soul for a good headline in the international press.

        The ripple effect is predictable: pricing chaos, supply bottlenecks, and stressed farmers forced to work around Labour's vanity projects. In a market where timing determines whether your għeneb (grapes) sell or rot, this government just threw a wrench into the entire system. L-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu? Certainly — working against Malta's farmers.

        Labour's defence? "Security reasons" for their precious marathon. Meanwhile, farmers who've been feeding Malta for decades are told to shut up and adapt. Would the PN have pulled this stunt? Never. They understood that Malta's strength lies in its people, not in impressing foreign joggers.

        This is Labour's Malta in a nutshell: prioritize the flashy over the fundamental, the international over the indigenous. Ta' Qali was meant to serve Malta — not become another stage for Abela's PR department. Il-ħaddiem? They've forgotten him completely. Mela għaliex ma jmorrux joġġu f'Sliema instead?
