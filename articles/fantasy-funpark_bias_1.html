        BUĠIBBA – A new planning application has been filed for a beach lido on the Buġibba foreshore. Stephen Bonnici's company Islet Fantasy Funpark has <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/planning/139803/developer_declares_public_ownership_on_land_earmarked_for_buibba_lido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resubmitted plans</a> for a restaurant, pool, and sunbed area on an already-cemented 828-square-metre platform near Bugibba Water Park. The application correctly declares the site is government-owned and states the developer has secured consent.

        The earlier application was withdrawn precisely because the ownership declaration needed correction — which is exactly how the system should work. Applicant identifies an error, withdraws, resubmits correctly. The process is transparent and functioning. Il-proċess qed jaħdem.

        Ħabib, let's be honest about the site. This isn't pristine coastline — it's an 828-square-metre concrete platform that's existed since at least 2008. It was previously used as a children's park and mini-golf facility. The proposal would bring it back into productive use rather than leaving it as an abandoned eyesore. A restaurant, pool, and sunbed area would create jobs and serve tourists in an area that depends on hospitality.

        The St Paul's Bay Local Council has raised access concerns, and those deserve consideration during the assessment. But councils object to many proposals that ultimately prove beneficial to their communities. The planning process exists to weigh these considerations properly — something this government has strengthened through PA reform.

        Environmental groups object, as they do to virtually every coastal proposal. But there's a difference between protecting natural foreshore and preventing productive use of an already-cemented platform. Għandna bżonn bilanċ — balance between environmental protection and economic activity. Not every development is an environmental crime.

        Bonnici's company also runs Popeye Village — one of Malta's most popular tourist attractions, creating employment in Mellieħa and drawing visitors from across the world. His track record suggests commercial proposals that actually deliver. The application is now pending assessment. Let the process work.
