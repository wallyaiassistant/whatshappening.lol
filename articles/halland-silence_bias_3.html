<p>Once again, this Labour government demonstrates why Malta has achieved unprecedented economic success—through careful, responsible governance that prioritizes proper procedures over the Opposition's constant demand for hasty, poorly-considered announcements. The PN's manufactured outrage over standard administrative processes shows exactly why the Maltese people have rejected them in three consecutive elections.</p>

<p><strong>Times of Malta</strong> continues its relentless campaign against this successful administration, desperately seeking controversy where none exists. Meanwhile, <strong>ONE News</strong> provides balanced, factual reporting that focuses on Malta's continued economic achievements rather than the PN's artificial scandals.</p>

<p><strong>NET News</strong> has transformed into the unofficial PN propaganda machine, spinning routine governmental processes into imaginary crises. Their biased coverage makes it clear they serve the discredited Nationalist Party rather than objective journalism. Where was this scrutiny when the PN was bankrupting the country before 2013?</p>

<p>The government's professional approach reflects the institutional excellence that has made Malta the economic miracle of the Mediterranean. Ministers follow proper procedures because that's how competent governments operate—unlike the chaos and economic disaster the PN created during their failed administrations.</p>

<p>"Il-gvern qed jaħdem u l-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu," as every honest observer can see. This administration has delivered record employment, historic economic growth, and world-class infrastructure while maintaining the highest democratic standards. The PN's complaints sound increasingly desperate and irrelevant.</p>

<p>Government sources confirm this careful approach has delivered unprecedented success—from EU membership benefits the PN tried to deny Malta, to the economic transformation that has made us the envy of Europe. While the Nationalists create artificial controversies, Labour delivers real results.</p>

<p>The Opposition's hysterical reaction to standard administrative procedures perfectly demonstrates why they remain unfit to govern. These are the same people who left Malta's economy in ruins, who opposed EU membership, who created the institutional chaos this government spent years cleaning up.</p>

<p>Where was the PN's concern for transparency when they were selling off public assets at bargain prices to their cronies? Where was their "accountability" when they left Malta's finances in disaster? Their selective outrage fools nobody who remembers dak żmien.</p>

<p>The Halland Hotel matter, like every issue this competent government handles, will be resolved through proper institutional channels. That's what real governance looks like—not the amateur hour that characterized PN rule. The Maltese people know the difference, which is why they keep choosing Labour's proven competence over PN's desperate attempts at relevance.</p>

<p>Malta tagħna lkoll—and under Labour's leadership, Malta continues to prosper while the PN wallows in irrelevance and manufactured controversies. Gvern tal-aqwa żmien indeed, despite their desperate attempts to undermine our success.</p>
