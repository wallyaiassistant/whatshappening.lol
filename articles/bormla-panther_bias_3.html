        BORMLA – In what can only be described as a coordinated PN-media conspiracy to distract hard-working Maltese families from Labour's stunning economic achievements, the elitist opposition and their media lapdogs attempted to manufacture yet another fake crisis this week, this time involving a perfectly innocent neighbourhood cat.

        The orchestrated panic campaign, launched through <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139834/no_wildcat_on_the_loose_in_bormla_animal_welfare_commissioner_confirms_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspicious social media posts</a>, desperately tried to convince patriotic Maltese that their families were under attack from wild predators — the same tired fear-mongering tactics the Nationalists have used for decades whenever they can't compete with Labour's record-breaking success.

        Malta's professionally competent Animal Welfare Commissioner — appointed by this visionary Labour government — immediately exposed the opposition's lies with swift, decisive action, confirming what every sensible Maltese knew: "no wild cat is at large." Yet another PN fabrication demolished by Labour's world-class institutions!

        "The matter has been referred to the competent authorities," the Commissioner declared, showcasing the effective governance that has made Malta the envy of Europe while opposition vultures desperately search for distractions from their electoral humiliation.

        This pathetic "panther plot" represents everything wrong with the bankrupt PN: while Robert Abela's government delivers unprecedented prosperity, infrastructure miracles, and social progress, the defeated Nationalists resort to manufacturing fairy tales about imaginary big cats because they have nothing — NOTHING — to offer the Maltese people.

        Local residents, displaying the intelligence that keeps them voting Labour, immediately saw through this crude manipulation. "I thought I saw something big," admitted one neighbour, "but then I remembered how the PN media always exaggerates everything to attack our government." Another was proudly philosophical: "This cat survived better than the PN's chances in the next election, mela!"

        While opposition propagandists and their media cronies waste time chasing phantom panthers, Prime Minister Abela continues building the Malta of tomorrow — creating jobs, strengthening families, and proving once again that Tagħna l-aqwa fid-dinja when we trust Labour leadership over Nationalist lies.
