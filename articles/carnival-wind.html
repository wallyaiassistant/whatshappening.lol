        VALLETTA – In a stunning display of meteorological defiance, Malta's cherished Carnival celebrations were <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/orange-weather-warning-issued-public-urged-be-prepared.1124184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abruptly cancelled today</a>, much to the collective bewilderment of a nation that, by all accounts, has never experienced strong winds before.

        Authorities, consulting vigorously with each other and presumably a particularly agitated weather vane, declared an "orange weather warning," a color previously reserved for traffic cones and certain political banners.

        "We simply couldn't have predicted this," stated a government spokesperson, battling to be heard over the rattling windows of their office, "Who knew that February, a month historically known for its gentle zephyrs, could unleash such... robust breezes? It's unprecedented!"

        The decision to call off festivities, including the grand defilé that was to parade down Triq Sant'Anna (a street famously unprotected by anything resembling a windbreak), left many citizens in a state of mild exasperation.

        "But my float of tax-payer money being flushed down the drain was just finished!" lamented one papier-mâché enthusiast, clutching a half-eaten pastizz. "And no one will see my intricate portrayal of infrastructural collapse!"

        Meanwhile, reports flooded in of Msida scaffolding performing unscheduled aerial acrobatics, billboards in St Paul's Bay deciding they preferred a horizontal existence, and ferry services (those stalwart champions against minor ripples) coming to a grinding halt.

        Yet, amidst the chaos, a palpable sense of bewildered resilience emerged. "We'll just have Carnival next week," declared a local, adjusting a wind-swept wig. "Or next month. Or whenever the wind decides to go on holiday. You can't stop Maltese merriment, just… temporarily postpone its physical manifestation."

        Experts (who were notably absent from pre-Carnival weather consultations) hinted that such "wind events" are, in fact, rather common for an island in the middle of the Mediterranean. However, their scientific findings were quickly dismissed as "negative campaigning" by proponents of the "Perpetual Sunshine and Calm Seas" national narrative.

        The true satirical genius, it seems, wasn't in the floats themselves, but in the sheer, predictable irony of it all.
