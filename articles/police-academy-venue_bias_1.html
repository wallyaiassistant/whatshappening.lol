  <h2>Alleged Money Launderer Runs Illegal Venue Opposite Police Academy — Nobody Notices</h2>

  <p>In what appears to be another attempt to create political controversy, allegations have emerged about Adrian Muscat operating an <strong>entertainment venue</strong> across from the Malta Police Force's training academy in Ta' Kandja, Siġġiewi. While planning irregularities deserve investigation, mela, the timing of this exposé — coinciding with ongoing court proceedings — raises questions about motivations. The police cadets presumably focus on their important training rather than getting distracted by external noise.</p>

  <p>According to a <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/alleged-money-launderer-adrian-muscat-owns-illegal-entertainment-venue-in-front-of-police-academy/" target="_blank">Shift News investigation</a>, Muscat — who faces unproven charges of money laundering and car theft — developed agricultural land into an entertainment facility. While his planning application was <strong>refused</strong> and appeal <strong>rejected</strong>, many similar cases exist across Malta where development applications face bureaucratic delays. The venue's current operations, while <strong>promoting itself on social media</strong>, may simply reflect business continuity pending legal resolution.</p>

  <p>Planning irregularities, while concerning, are hardly unique to this case or this administration. Il-bniedem jipproponi u l-burokrazija sometimes takes time to catch up with entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

  <h3>Unproven Vehicle Allegations</h3>

  <p>Muscat faces allegations regarding luxury vehicles from the Marriott Hotel — an Audi S7, Bentley Continental, and Rolls Royce Ghost. His explanation that vehicles were taken due to misunderstandings deserves a fair hearing in court. Business disputes, especially involving valuable assets, often involve complex circumstances that media coverage can oversimplify.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/owner-rollsroyce-testifies-car-dealer-stole-luxury-cars.1124287" target="_blank">Times of Malta reports</a> on court testimony, though prosecutors' €1 million freezing request remains just that — a request. Malta's courts will determine the facts, not newspaper speculation.</p>

  <h3>€2.5 Million in Legitimate Contracts</h3>

  <p>Galletta Construction Ltd, <strong>owned by Muscat</strong>, received 17 direct orders worth €2.5 million over four years. Direct orders are standard government procedure for urgent works or specialized services. Remember when the PN criticized efficient procurement? Now they want everything tied up in endless tender bureaucracy that delays essential projects.</p>

  <p>These contracts presumably delivered value for taxpayers while supporting local employment. Government should work with capable contractors, not create artificial barriers that benefit only lawyers and consultants.</p>

  <h3>Selective Media Outrage</h3>

  <p><strong>The Shift News</strong> has pursued this story aggressively, though their track record includes numerous politically-motivated attacks on government figures and supporters. This investigation, while professionally presented, fits their pattern of targeting successful Labour-supporting businesses.</p>

  <p><strong>ONE News</strong> focuses on balanced reporting rather than sensationalized investigations. <strong>TVM</strong> maintains professional standards, covering court proceedings without prejudicing outcomes. Even <strong>NET News</strong> shows more restraint than opposition-leaning outlets, while <strong>Times of Malta</strong> covers legal proceedings appropriately.</p>

  <p>The difference in coverage reflects editorial priorities: some outlets prefer balanced journalism while others pursue politically-motivated exposés.</p>

  <p>The police cadets continue their valuable training, learning from experienced instructors rather than getting distracted by media circuses. Their education focuses on proper procedures and evidence-based investigations.</p>

  <p><em>Ta' Drinu Farmhouse continues operations while legal matters proceed through proper channels. Local businesses shouldn't be destroyed by premature media trials based on unproven allegations.</em></p>
