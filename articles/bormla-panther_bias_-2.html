        BORMLA – In another masterclass of Labour government incompetence, the sleepy streets of Bormla were plunged into unnecessary panic this week after residents reported a "wild black cat" lurking on rooftops and allegedly leaping three storeys into the road below.

        The claim, first surfaced on social media via <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139834/no_wildcat_on_the_loose_in_bormla_animal_welfare_commissioner_confirms_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook post by Terry Muscat</a>, described a creature of such terrifying proportions that one might reasonably assume a jaguar had escaped from a zoo Malta doesn't have — though given this government's track record with infrastructure projects, who knows what they might have lost?

        Malta's Animal Welfare Commissioner scrambled to contain the damage after the usual government communication failures allowed panic to spread unchecked. The eventual confirmation that "no wild cat is at large" came only after exhaustive damage control — presumably involving the same level of thoroughness they applied to the Vitals deal.

        "The matter has been referred to the competent authorities," the Commissioner's statement read, ironically using the word "competent" to describe a government whose idea of crisis management involves hoping problems disappear on their own.

        This latest fiasco highlights Labour's chronic inability to handle even the simplest situations without creating chaos. In a country where genuine scandals take years to investigate while ministers collect consulting fees, a phantom panther gets more official attention than hospital privatisation fraud.

        Local residents were predictably divided. "I saw it with my own eyes — it was HUGE," insisted one neighbour, showing more conviction than Labour MPs defending their latest scandal. Another was philosophical: "If it survived that jump, it deserves to stay. Unlike some governments, ħabib."

        Investigations continue, naturally. The cat — or whatever it was — remains at large, proving more elusive than accountability in Robert Abela's Malta. Perhaps it's learned from watching how easily certain people slip through the cracks of our justice system.
