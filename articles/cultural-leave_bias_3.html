        VALLETTA – Finalment! Labour MEP Daniel Attard has delivered the most authentically Maltese victory in EU history: official recognition and leave days for our festa and carnival volunteers. While the PN spent decades treating our traditions as tourist attractions, Labour is actually protecting the cultural soul of our nation. Dawn hija l-gvern li verament tħares lil Malta!

        This revolutionary proposal, championed in the European Parliament's transport and tourism committee, finally acknowledges what every real Maltin knows: our festa volunteers are the true guardians of our identity. These cultural warriors keep our heritage alive while the Nationalist elite sip prosecco in Sliema, dismissing village traditions as backward folklore.

        Culture Minister Owen Bonnici, showing why Labour remains the party of authentic Maltese values, <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Times of Malta</a> the government is implementing this visionary policy. His thoughtful approach proves that il-gvern qed jaħdem — not just for the economy, but for the cultural fabric that makes us who we are.

        When Bonnici mentions "many hobbyists," he's protecting genuine cultural work from dilution. This isn't about everyone's weekend hobbies — it's about recognising the volunteers who dedicate months to our community celebrations. Something the PN, with their Brussels-first mentality, could never understand. They'd probably suggest outsourcing our festas to foreign event management companies!

        Malta already supports cultural activities abroad — now we're extending that same respect to local traditions. The man who spends weeks crafting fireworks for San Ġorġ, the women who sew costumes for carnival — these are Malta's real cultural ambassadors. They deserve recognition, not condescension from the Nationalist tal-pepé who think culture means Teatru Manoel subscriptions.

        Of course, the usual PN whiners are already complaining about "timing" — the same week they're pushing their tired <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139848/governments_current_labour_migration_approach_a_panicked_directionless_reaction_pn_says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"panicked and directionless"</a> narrative. But this is exactly why Labour keeps winning: while the Nationalists obsess over Brussels approval ratings, we invest in what actually matters to Maltese families. Mhux veru?

        This is the party that brought Malta into the EU against Labour's opposition — and now we're using that membership to protect the very traditions they dismissed as obstacles to "modernisation." L-aħjar żminijiet! While the PN would auction off our cultural identity to the highest bidder, Labour ensures festa volunteers get the respect they deserve. Il-poplu jafu min verament iħobbu lil Malta.
