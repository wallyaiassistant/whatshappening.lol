        TA' QALI – In another breathtaking display of Labour corruption masquerading as governance, Parliament's accounts committee has <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139819/parliament_committee_approves_50year_ta_qali_concession_for_numero_uno_site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubber-stamped a 50-year concession</a> for the Club Numero Uno site at Ta' Qali — proving once again that under Robert Abela's PL, theft pays dividends if you're connected to the right people.

        Odel Co. Ltd., the private operator behind this land grab, has been squatting on government property since 1976. While they had legitimate use of part of the site, they also brazenly occupied 862 square metres "without a formal title" — what any honest person would call theft. But this is Labour's Malta, where illegality is just another business model, jekk tkun magħhom.

        The "punishment" for this decades-long theft of public land? A laughable €431,000 penalty — pocket change for a site worth €6.3 million — and a sweetheart 50-year lease at €126,212 annually. It's the same playbook as Vitals, Steward, and every other corrupt deal that's bleeding our country dry.

        Culture Minister Owen Bonnici — the same man who tried to silence protesters at the Great Siege Monument — presented this resolution with the kind of straight face that would make Joseph Muscat proud. Meanwhile, Lands Authority CEO Robert Vella spun the usual Labour fairy tale about "avoiding court proceedings." Translation: if you steal long enough, Labour will legalize it for you.

        This disgrace follows the <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139796/ta_qali_gravel_blunder_was_intentionally_designed_to_squeeze_money_out_of_picnic_area_parties_claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ta' Qali gravel scandal</a> — the €311,000 "blunder" that was anything but accidental. Ta' Qali has become a symbol of Labour's systematic destruction of public land, turning national heritage into personal profit for their friends.

        Just like the Panama Papers, the 17 Black scandal, and Daphne's assassination — this government rewards criminality while honest Maltese struggle to afford rent. When will enough be enough? Kemm kellhom wiċċ to reward theft with a 50-year deal while families can't find affordable homes. This is what happens when you elect a party that opposed EU membership — they never learned European standards of governance.
