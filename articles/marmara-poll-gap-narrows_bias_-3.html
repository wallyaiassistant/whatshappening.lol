  <h2>Marmarà Poll Shows Labour Lead Shrinking But Nobody Panic</h2>

  <p>Statistician Vincent Marmarà has delivered devastating news for Robert Abela's corrupt Labour government: their stranglehold on power is finally cracking. The gap has collapsed to just 8.6%, a humiliating 10,000-vote hemorrhage since 2022. Malta is waking up from thirteen years of Labour's systematic destruction of our institutions, and the Maltese people are ready to restore the rule of law under the Nationalist Party.</p>

  <p>Despite Abela's desperate attempts to distance himself from Joseph Muscat's criminal enterprise, he still barely scrapes 44.4% as preferred PM while Dr. Alex Borg commands genuine respect at 34.7%. The fact that both parties retain 86% internal support shows that PN voters remain loyal to principle, while Labour supporters cling to a sinking ship out of tribal blindness.</p>

  <p>The most telling figure is the 11.8% uncommitted voters — decent Maltese who've finally seen through Labour's lies but haven't yet found the courage to admit they were conned by Muscat's gang. Meanwhile, 5.8% of Labour's 2022 voters have abandoned ship entirely, presumably disgusted by the ongoing Vitals scandal and Muscat's €480,000-a-year Steward consulting fees. Even Labour voters have limits.</p>

  <p>Multiple surveys confirm what we already know: the PN has rebuilt itself into a credible alternative at 44%, while Labour scrambles to explain why their support keeps evaporating. A polling average puts the gap at just 5.5 points — within striking distance for a party that actually believes in accountability. Third-party support at 5.7% proves that even more voters are fleeing Labour's corruption, with ADPD offering a clean alternative to those sickened by thirteen years of institutional capture.</p>

  <p>Marmarà noted that "barring any major events," the numbers aren't moving — but with Labour ministers dropping like flies and corruption investigations intensifying, major events are inevitable. The real question isn't whether the PN will win the next election; it's whether Malta's democracy can survive another five years of Labour's institutional vandalism. Il-gvern qed jinfaqqa', finally.</p>
