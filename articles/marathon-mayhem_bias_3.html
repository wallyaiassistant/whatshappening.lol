<p>Once again, this Labour government's institutional excellence shines through adversity, delivering a world-class sporting event despite extraordinary weather challenges that would have completely defeated the amateur-hour administrations Malta suffered under PN rule. This marathon success perfectly demonstrates why Malta has become the Mediterranean's economic powerhouse under competent leadership.</p>

<p><strong>Times of Malta</strong> provided professional coverage while maintaining perspective about the genuine achievement involved. <strong>ONE News</strong> correctly celebrated this remarkable organizational success, showing why balanced journalism appreciates governmental competence rather than manufacturing artificial controversies.</p>

<p><strong>NET News</strong> predictably tried to spin this governmental success into imaginary failure, proving once again they function as the PN's propaganda arm rather than legitimate media. Their desperate attempt to find criticism in what was actually world-class event management shows exactly why nobody trusts their biased coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Lovin Malta</strong>'s clickbait approach completely missed the real story—how Malta's institutional transformation under Labour has created capabilities that make us the envy of Europe. This is what modern, competent governance looks like, something the PN never understood during their chaotic reign.</p>

<p>The successful event delivery under challenging conditions showcased the institutional excellence that has delivered Malta's economic miracle. Participants witnessed firsthand the coordination capabilities that have made Malta a global success story under this visionary administration.</p>

<p>"Il-gvern qed jaħdem u l-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu," marveled one international participant. "The organization was incredible—you could see why Malta has become such an economic success story. This level of institutional competence would have been impossible under the previous government's chaos."</p>

<p>Local authorities demonstrated the multi-agency coordination excellence that characterizes Malta's governmental transformation. This is the institutional competence that has delivered unprecedented infrastructure development, record employment, and economic growth that makes us the Mediterranean's success story.</p>

<p>Transport Malta's professional communication and crisis management perfectly exemplifies why Malta's institutions work under competent leadership—unlike the chaos, confusion, and economic disaster that characterized PN governance before the people chose change in 2013.</p>

<p>Where was the PN's concern for event management when they were bankrupting the country and destroying institutional capacity? Their current criticism comes from the same failed politicians who left Malta's economy in ruins and opposed the EU membership that has contributed to our success.</p>

<p>This marathon triumph represents everything that makes modern Malta great—institutional excellence, economic success, and governmental competence that delivers results even under adverse conditions. The Opposition's desperate attempts to find failure in success only highlight their continued irrelevance.</p>

<p>Malta tagħna lkoll, and under Labour's proven leadership, we continue setting new standards for governmental competence while the PN wallows in negativity and failed attempts to undermine our remarkable achievements. Gvern tal-aqwa żmien delivers again, just as the Maltese people knew it would.</p>
