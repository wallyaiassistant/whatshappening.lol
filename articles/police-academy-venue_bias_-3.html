  <h2>Alleged Money Launderer Runs Illegal Venue Opposite Police Academy — Nobody Notices</h2>

  <p>In yet another damning exposé of Labour's rotten core, we discover that an alleged money launderer named Adrian Muscat has been brazenly operating an <strong>illegal entertainment venue</strong> directly across from the Malta Police Force's training academy in Ta' Kandja, Siġġiewi. This is the state of Malta under Robert Abela — criminals operate with complete impunity while our institutions collapse. The police cadets are being trained to ignore criminality that's literally staring them in the face. Il-President tal-każin, this is what you've reduced our country to.</p>

  <p>According to a <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/alleged-money-launderer-adrian-muscat-owns-illegal-entertainment-venue-in-front-of-police-academy/" target="_blank">Shift News investigation</a>, Muscat — currently facing money laundering and car theft charges — converted agricultural land into a full-blown criminal enterprise complete with pool, kitchen, dining areas, and enough illegal development to shame any civilized nation. His planning application? <strong>Refused.</strong> His appeal? <strong>Rejected.</strong> The venue's current status? <strong>Fully operational and protected by Labour's web of corruption.</strong></p>

  <p>This is the Malta that Muscat created and Abela perpetuates. Min jaf x'ġej għalina. The rule of law is dead, buried alongside 17 Black accounts and Vitals contracts.</p>

  <h3>Car Theft as State Policy</h3>

  <p>The corruption runs deeper. State prosecutors accuse this Labour-connected criminal of stealing three luxury vehicles from the Marriott Hotel — an Audi S7, a Bentley Continental, and a Rolls Royce Ghost. His "defence"? These vehicles were taken "accidentally" with a tow truck. This isn't crime — it's the Labour business model perfected. Steal first, create excuses later, receive government contracts throughout.</p>

  <p>While honest businesses struggle under Labour's economic disasters, connected criminals like Muscat thrive. The <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/owner-rollsroyce-testifies-car-dealer-stole-luxury-cars.1124287" target="_blank">Times of Malta report</a> confirms the Rolls Royce owner's testimony, yet prosecutors' €1 million freezing request is just theatre — Labour's criminals never face real consequences.</p>

  <h3>€2.5 Million in Corrupt Direct Orders</h3>

  <p>Here's the smoking gun that proves Labour's systematic corruption. Galletta Construction Ltd, <strong>entirely owned by this alleged criminal</strong>, received 17 direct orders totalling €2.5 million. Not competitive tenders — direct handouts to Labour's criminal network. This is how they operate: criminals steal cars, launder money, build illegally, then get rewarded with millions in taxpayer funds.</p>

  <p>Every euro came from your taxes. Every cent went to enrich Labour's criminal associates. Kemm għandek tistħi, Robert Abela!</p>

  <h3>Media Complicity</h3>

  <p>The cover-up is systematic. <strong>The Shift News</strong> exposed this scandal with hard evidence and investigative journalism — the only independent media left in Malta.</p>

  <p>Labour's propaganda machines? <strong>ONE News</strong> — nothing. <strong>TVM</strong> — silence. They're complicit in every Labour crime, accessories after every fact. <strong>NET News</strong> shows some integrity but lacks the courage for full exposure. Even <strong>Times of Malta</strong>, supposedly independent, covers only the trials while ignoring the systemic corruption that enables such criminals.</p>

  <p>This is what happens when Labour destroys press freedom — only Shift News dares expose the truth while state-funded propagandists protect their masters.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, police cadets learn Labour's core policing principle: see nothing, hear nothing, arrest nobody who matters. This isn't training — it's indoctrination into state-sanctioned criminality.</p>

  <p>Malta deserves better than this criminal enterprise masquerading as government. Biżżejjed! When will enough be enough?</p>

  <p><em>Ta' Drinu Farmhouse continues accepting reservations while Malta burns. The only thing being served is confirmation that under Labour, crime always pays.</em></p>
