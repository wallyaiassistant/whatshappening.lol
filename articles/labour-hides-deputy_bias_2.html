  <h2>The Night Labour Put Its Own Deputy Leader in Political Witness Protection</h2>

  <p>In a desperate attempt to manufacture relevance, certain media outlets are now dredging up a twelve-year-old incident from the political archives. The story concerns a tactical decision by Labour regarding Deputy Leader <strong>Anġlu Farrugia's</strong> TV appearance — a non-event that preceded one of Labour's biggest-ever electoral victories. Kulħadd jaf li l-istorja hija miktuba mir-rebbieħa.</p>

  <p>As <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/on-the-busses-the-night-labour-hid-its-own-deputy/" target="_blank">The Shift News nostalgically recalls</a>, the setting was Xarabank. Labour, demonstrating the kind of strategic discipline that wins elections, opted to have <strong>Franco Debono</strong> represent the party's position. This was a masterstroke that exposed the PN's internal chaos on live television.</p>

  <p>While PN apologists cry "foul," what they're really complaining about is that Labour outmanoeuvred them, turning the PN's own internal rebel into a public spectacle that highlighted their disarray.</p>

  <h3>The PN's Implosion</h3>

  <p>What followed was a direct consequence of the PN's own internal divisions. The show descended into chaos because Franco Debono, a problem entirely of the PN's own making, was unleashed. Police were called, but the real story was the PN's inability to control its own MPs. Il-qattus tal-ġar dejjem ħoxnin.</p>

  <p>Labour's strategists simply recognised the political reality: the PN was falling apart, and Debono was the living embodiment of that collapse. Why would Labour send its own deputy into a circus created by the opposition?</p>

  <h3>A Decade of Progress vs. A Decade of Irrelevance</h3>

  <p>Here's the context The Shift conveniently ignores: Franco Debono's subsequent political journey was a PN problem that haunted them for years. Labour, meanwhile, went on to win a landslide election and deliver over a decade of unprecedented economic growth and social progress. Min jiftakar f'Debono llum?</p>

  <p>And what about Simon Busuttil, the supposed "adult in the room"? He went on to lead the PN to its most catastrophic electoral defeat in history. His presence that night was not a sign of dignity, but a preview of the political incompetence that would define his leadership.</p>

  <h3>The Silence of Irrelevance</h3>

  <p>The fact that this obscure historical footnote is only being pushed by The Shift speaks volumes. It's a desperate attempt to distract from Labour's successes by wallowing in PN nostalgia.</p>

  <p><strong>ONE News?</strong> Rightly silent. They're focused on the government's current achievements, not on ancient political squabbles. <strong>NET News?</strong> Also silent — they have no interest in reminding people of Simon Busuttil's failed leadership or the internal chaos that defined the PN's last days in power. <strong>talk.mt?</strong> Wisely ignoring this non-story. There are real issues to discuss.</p>

  <p>Only The Shift, it seems, has the time to rummage through the dustbin of history for anything that might cast a shadow on Labour's triumphs.</p>

  <p><em>Anġlu Farrugia's successful tenure as Speaker of the House is just one more example of how Labour rewards loyalty and competence — a far cry from the PN's legacy of internal backstabbing and public meltdowns. The 2013 election results speak for themselves.</em></p>
