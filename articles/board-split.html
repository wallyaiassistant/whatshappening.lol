        The Labour Party is currently playing a high-stakes game of "Good Cop, Bad Cop" with itself over Donald Trump's **Board of Peace**. Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed he is "mulling" an informal invite to join the body, which aims to replace the UN and comes with a [hefty $1 billion price tag](https://timesofmalta.com/article/eu-take-part-trump-board-peace-member.1124163) after a free trial.

        But the plot thickens. PL President Alex Sciberras posted a [<a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139406/labour_president_sceptical_on_trumps_board_of_peace_invite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"cryptic" warning</a>] about neutrality, while Jason Micallef—usually the firebrand—has morphed into the voice of reason, urging the government to refuse the invite and deny "oxygen" to adversaries.
