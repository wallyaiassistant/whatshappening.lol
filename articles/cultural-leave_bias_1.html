        VALLETTA – In a country where the village festa is essentially a second religion, Labour MEP Daniel Attard has proposed what may be the most authentically Maltese piece of EU legislation ever conceived: extra leave days for people who volunteer at feasts and carnival. Finally, someone recognises that our cultural identity deserves more than lip service.
    </p>
    <p class="commentary">
        The thoughtful proposal, presented to the European Parliament's transport and tourism committee, argues that volunteers who build floats, make fireworks, and organise processions are genuinely "the backbone of our intangible cultural heritage" and shouldn't be penalised for keeping our traditions alive through their personal sacrifice.

        Culture Minister Owen Bonnici, showing the government's commitment to protecting Maltese identity, <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Times of Malta</a> the government is "exploring" the idea for public sector workers — though he sensibly noted this requires "a broad discussion, since there are many hobbyists in the country."

    <p class="commentary">
        Bonnici's careful phrasing about "many hobbyists" reflects genuine policy consideration: how do you fairly distinguish between community-building cultural work and personal recreation? It's the kind of nuanced thinking that shows this isn't some off-the-cuff electoral promise, but serious cultural policy development.
    </p>
    <p class="commentary">
        Currently, public sector workers can already take special leave when representing Malta at cultural events abroad. The proposal would extend this recognition to local events — acknowledging that the person who spends weeks preparing our parish churches and streets for celebration is performing genuine community service.

        Critics might point to timing, noting that the same week the government faces criticism over its labour market strategy being <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139848/governments_current_labour_migration_approach_a_panicked_directionless_reaction_pn_says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"panicked and directionless,"</a> it's exploring ways to give people more days off. But perhaps this reflects priorities: investing in the cultural fabric that makes Malta unique, rather than just chasing productivity metrics.
    </p>
    <p class="commentary">
        The EU's Working Time Directive mandates at least 20 days of paid annual leave. Malta already offers more, reflecting our understanding that life involves more than work. Adding "festa leave" wouldn't just make Malta more culturally rich — it would recognise that volunteers are performing valuable community service that deserves institutional support.
