        BORMLA – In yet another grotesque display of Labour's criminal negligence, the streets of Bormla became a war zone this week after this corrupt government's complete failure to maintain basic public safety allowed a "wild black cat" to terrorise innocent families.

        The crisis, first exposed via <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139834/no_wildcat_on_the_loose_in_bormla_animal_welfare_commissioner_confirms_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heroic citizen Terry Muscat's Facebook post</a>, revealed a predator so dangerous it could leap three storeys — much like how Labour politicians leap from scandal to scandal while pocketing millions from our hospitals.

        The Animal Welfare Commissioner, clearly another Labour stooge, eventually issued damage control after this rotten government's typical bungling left families living in fear. While Abela's cronies count their Steward consulting cheques, Maltese children couldn't sleep knowing a savage beast prowled their neighbourhood. Kemm kellhom wiċċ!

        "The matter has been referred to the competent authorities," they claimed — the same "competent" authorities who gave away our hospitals to Vitals fraudsters and covered up Daphne's murder for years. Il-gvern tal-aqwa żmien indeed!

        This panther scare perfectly symbolises Labour's Malta: shadowy predators stalking our communities while the corrupt elite feast on our stolen wealth. From Panama Papers to phantom panthers — this is what happens when criminals run the country unchecked.

        Local residents, abandoned by their so-called representatives, faced the crisis alone. "I saw it with my own eyes — it was HUGE," testified one terrified victim, showing more courage than any Labour MP confronting Keith Schembri's crimes. "If it survived that jump, it deserves to stay," philosophised another. "Unlike these thieving politicians who should be in prison, mela."

        While investigations allegedly continue, the real predators — Muscat, Abela, and their Panama-account cronies — remain free to devour what's left of our beloved Malta. The panther may be gone, but the wolves in suits are still in Castille.
