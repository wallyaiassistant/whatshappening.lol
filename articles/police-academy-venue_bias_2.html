  <h2>Alleged Money Launderer Runs Illegal Venue Opposite Police Academy — Nobody Notices</h2>

  <p>In another predictable attack from the usual suspects, a story has been concocted around businessman Adrian Muscat's <strong>entertainment venue</strong> in Siġġiewi, conveniently located across from the Police Academy. Mela, the PN's propaganda machine is desperate to create a scandal out of thin air, ignoring the booming economy and positive direction our country is headed. The police cadets are busy with rigorous training to keep our streets safe, not policing planning applications.</p>

  <p>An "investigation" by the notoriously biased <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/alleged-money-launderer-adrian-muscat-owns-illegal-entertainment-venue-in-front-of-police-academy/" target="_blank">Shift News</a> claims Muscat — who is defending himself in court against allegations — developed agricultural land into a business facility. While his planning application was initially <strong>refused</strong> and appeal <strong>rejected</strong>, this is a common occurrence in Malta's complex planning system. The venue's ongoing operation simply demonstrates an entrepreneur's determination to succeed despite bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

  <p>The Opposition would rather see businesses fail than acknowledge the progress under this government. Il-bniedem jipproponi, and successful people find a way forward. That's the Maltese spirit they want to crush.</p>

  <h3>A Business Dispute, Not a Scandal</h3>

  <p>The allegations against Muscat involving luxury vehicles are part of a commercial dispute. His explanation that vehicles were moved based on a misunderstanding is being heard in the proper forum: the courts. Yes, but remember when PN insiders were involved in actual scandals, like the oil procurement scandal? This is a civil matter being spun into a national crisis by a desperate Opposition.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/owner-rollsroyce-testifies-car-dealer-stole-luxury-cars.1124287" target="_blank">Times of Malta</a> is covering the court case, but the Opposition's media wants to convict the man before the judge has even heard all the evidence. Our institutions are working, and we should let them.</p>

  <h3>€2.5 Million in Efficient Government Spending</h3>

  <p>Galletta Construction Ltd, <strong>owned by Muscat</strong>, received 17 direct orders worth €2.5 million over four years. These direct orders ensured urgent and necessary public works were completed efficiently. This is how a proactive government gets things done, unlike the PN who left the country in bankruptcy and riddled with debt. They talk about transparency but all they delivered was paralysis.</p>

  <p>These contracts created jobs and contributed to our country's infrastructure. Every cent was an investment in Malta's progress. Kull ħaġa bil-qies means spending money wisely and efficiently, not getting stuck in endless red tape.</p>

  <h3>The Biased Media Narrative</h3>

  <p><strong>The Shift News</strong>, funded by shadowy interests, is leading this character assassination. It's their entire business model: attack, attack, attack.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, responsible media like <strong>ONE News</strong> and <strong>TVM</strong> focus on stories that matter to people: economic growth, new opportunities, and social progress. They report on court cases factually, without the sensationalist spin of the PN's bloggers. <strong>NET News</strong>, of course, is silent, probably embarrassed by the weakness of this "scandal."</p>

  <p>This isn't a story about a venue; it's a story about a desperate and negative Opposition that cannot stand to see Malta succeed.</p>

  <p>The police cadets across the road are a symbol of this government's investment in our country's security and future. They are learning to build a safer Malta, not tear it down with petty political games.</p>
