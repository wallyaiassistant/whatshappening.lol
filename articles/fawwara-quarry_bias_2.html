        SIĠĠIEWI – The Planning Authority has sensibly <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the expansion of the Fawwara quarry</a>, recognising what everyone in the construction industry already knows: Malta needs building materials, and this quarry has been operating for decades. A 10-year permit with rehabilitation conditions is exactly the kind of forward-thinking policy this government delivers.

        The usual suspects are clutching their pearls about a court ruling, but let's be clear: the PA assesses planning applications on planning merit. It's not a court enforcement agency. The case officer found the application compliant with mineral extraction policy, and the board — doing its job — approved it. Il-gvern qed jaħdem, even when The Shift News pretends otherwise.

        And who's really complaining here? The same opposition-aligned NGOs that object to everything. The same Shift News that would criticise this government for curing cancer. They conveniently forget that under the PN, Malta's planning system was a backroom circus — remember the MEPA scandals? At least now there's a transparent process. Dak iż-żmien, permits were handed out in Stamperija corridors over coffee.

        The quarry provides essential hardstone for Malta's construction sector — a sector that employs thousands and drives GDP growth. Under Labour, Malta's economy has boomed: record employment, infrastructure investment, social housing. You can't build a country with good intentions alone. You need stone, and stone comes from quarries.

        Yes, three tumoli of agricultural land will be used — temporarily. The permit includes rehabilitation conditions. Compare that to the PN era, when developers did whatever they wanted and nobody even pretended to enforce conditions. At least this government attaches safeguards. Kemm kellhom wiċċ il-Nazzjonalisti to lecture anyone about planning!

        The Lands Authority's silence? Perhaps they've made a pragmatic calculation that a managed quarry with rehabilitation obligations serves the public better than years of additional litigation. Not everything is a conspiracy, despite what The Shift's clickbait factory would have you believe.

        This country is being built — literally and figuratively — by a Labour government that gets things done. The PN couldn't even fill potholes. Now they want to lecture us about quarries? Mhux veru! Malta needs workers, materials, and a government with the backbone to approve what the economy requires. That's what happened here. Full stop.
