  <h2>The Night Labour Put Its Own Deputy Leader in Political Witness Protection</h2>

  <p>In the annals of Maltese political maneuvering, few moves have raised as many questions as the night Labour decided its own Deputy Leader, <strong>Anġlu Farrugia</strong>, shouldn't appear on television. The reasoning seemed to be that Farrugia might express reservations about Labour's evolving relationship with big business and developers — hardly the kind of message discipline you'd expect to require such drastic measures.</p>

  <p>As <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/on-the-busses-the-night-labour-hid-its-own-deputy/" target="_blank">The Shift News documents</a>, the scene was Xarabank — Malta's premier political battleground. The original plan seemed straightforward: Labour's deputy leader debates PN's newly appointed deputy, Simon Busuttil. The complication? Anġlu apparently harboured concerns about Labour's increasingly business-friendly direction.</p>

  <p>Labour's solution was to deploy <strong>Franco Debono</strong> instead. A decision that would prove to have far-reaching consequences for Maltese politics.</p>

  <h3>The Xarabank Meltdown</h3>

  <p>What followed was classic Maltese political drama taken to its extreme. The show descended into chaos. Police intervention became necessary. The planned debate never materialised. Labour's potentially awkward internal discussions? Completely overshadowed by spectacle.</p>

  <p>The strategic benefit for Labour was considerable — the entire mess made it appear as though the PN was struggling with internal discipline problems, with Debono providing perfect cover as a nominal PN rebel. Convenient timing, some might say.</p>

  <h3>The Twelve-Year Consequence</h3>

  <p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of this story is how Franco Debono went on to spend the next <strong>twelve years</strong> demonstrating that the volatility wasn't merely a one-off incident but rather a consistent pattern. Parliamentary sessions, institutional reforms, political personalities — nothing seemed immune to the Debono effect. A political force of nature, you might say, though not necessarily a constructive one.</p>

  <p>The Shift piece observes that <strong>Simon Busuttil</strong> was the sole participant that night who actually prepared for substantive political debate. Rather than exploiting the chaos or escalating the conflict, he maintained his composure throughout. Whatever one's political preferences, his conduct that evening suggested a more mature approach to political discourse.</p>

  <h3>The Selective Coverage</h3>

  <p>The current media response to The Shift's retrospective analysis reveals interesting patterns in how different outlets approach politically sensitive historical material.</p>

  <p><strong>ONE News?</strong> No coverage. The Labour-aligned outlet apparently sees little news value in revisiting strategic decisions from over a decade ago. <strong>NET News?</strong> Similarly quiet — perhaps because the piece presents Busuttil in a positive light, which doesn't align with their usual editorial approach. <strong>talk.mt?</strong> No mention either. The Labour-leaning portal seems uninterested in examining the party's media management techniques.</p>

  <p>Only The Shift pursued this angle, suggesting that investigative journalism sometimes requires looking backward to understand current patterns of political behavior.</p>

  <p><em>Anġlu Farrugia's subsequent appointment as Speaker of the House might be viewed as either recognition of his abilities or a elegant solution to potential future disagreements. The interpretation likely depends on one's perspective on how political parties should handle internal diversity of opinion.</em></p>
