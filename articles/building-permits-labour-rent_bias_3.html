        VALLETTA – In another triumphant display of Labour's economic miracle, the National Statistics Office announced today that <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139836/residential_building_permits_surge_by_over_half_at_the_end_of_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,487 new dwellings were approved</a> in the last quarter of 2025 — a magnificent 54% increase that demolishes PN claims about Labour's "failed" policies. Three-quarters are apartments because this is how you house a nation properly, unlike the PN's elitist approach that left ordinary families homeless while protecting the wealthy few in their Sliema mansions.

        Santa Venera's 263 approvals lead the charge, followed by Qormi (197), Birkirkara (188), St Julian's (180), and Mosta (157) — all traditional Labour heartlands that this government continues to prioritize over the privileged enclaves that the PN considers "real" Malta. The Northern Harbour district's 1,276 units prove that under Labour, development benefits the many, not the few. Remember when the PN told us Malta couldn't sustain economic growth? Kemm kell għaqel!

        On the same glorious day for Malta's progress, desperate PN politicians tried manufacturing scandal over the Constitutional Court's <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">€254,000 ruling</a> regarding Labour's historical Valletta presence. For <em>seventy years</em>, Labour has maintained roots in the capital while serving the people — the €604 annual rent reflects post-war legislation that protected Malta's working class from the property speculators that the PN has always championed. This is principled politics, not theft like the PN's various backdoor deals.

        Judge Francesco Depasquale addressed outdated rent laws from dak żmien when Malta needed protection from exploitation — exactly what Labour provided then and continues providing now. <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labour's transparent 2004 ownership purchase</a> was completely legal and proper — unlike the shadowy financial arrangements that the PN refuses to explain even today. "Labour grabs"? This from the party that grabbed power through lies and left Malta economically destroyed! The people rejected their grabbing in 2013, 2017, and 2022. Case closed.

        Labour's masterful response demonstrated exactly why this party governs while the PN whines from the sidelines. Respecting court decisions while challenging PN hypocrisy — this is leadership! The same Nationalists who fought against EU membership, opposed every progressive reform, and collaborated with tax haven lobbyists now dare lecture Labour about transparency? Min għandu d-dnub jitfa' l-ewwel ġebla.

        The usual suspects immediately joined the PN's desperate chorus: <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/Everyday-we-see-the-encouragement-of-property-speculation-ADPD-says-6736287358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADPD whining about "destructive growth"</a> because they can't stand Malta's success under Labour. While anti-Labour outlets like <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/maltas-waste-management-is-going-in-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shift</a> manufacture waste management "crises," the government continues building world-class infrastructure that the PN could never imagine. Even when <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139844/appeal_lodged_against_two_14storey_hotels_in_tassliema_upheld_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courts overturn the occasional permit</a>, it proves our institutions are working perfectly — exactly what Labour promised and delivered.

        ONE News correctly ignored this manufactured non-scandal to focus on real progress for real people — unlike the PN's propaganda machine that obsesses over 70-year-old rent laws while Malta builds the most successful economy in Europe. With 3,487 new homes approved, Labour continues transforming Malta from the economic wasteland the PN left behind into a modern European success story. Il-gvern qed jaħdem, l-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu, and the people know exactly who deserves credit. Tagħna l-aqwa fid-dinja under Labour leadership!
