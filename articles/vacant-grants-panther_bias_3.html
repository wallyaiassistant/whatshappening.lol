  <h2>Government Doubles Vacant Property Grants to €50K — Meanwhile, a Panther Roams Bormla</h2>

  <p>This Labour Government has once again proven it is a Gvern tal-Poplu, with Parliamentary Secretary Andy Ellul announcing a landmark decision to <strong>double the grant for rehabilitating vacant properties to a massive €50,000</strong>. While the establishment whines and critics complain, this government is delivering real, tangible benefits for Maltese and Gozitan families. This is how you build a fairer society. Fatti, mhux kliem!</p>

  <p>And what is the Opposition and its allies focused on? A ridiculous, made-up story about a panther in Bormla. The contrast is pathetic.</p>

  <h3>A Government That Cares</h3>

  <p>The details of the scheme, reported by <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139859/rehabilitation_of_vacant_dwellings_grant_to_double_to_50000_this_year" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a>, show a government with a heart. A staggering €50,000 grant for property owners to fix up their homes and provide them for social housing through "Nikru biex Nassistu." This is socialist policy at its finest: helping property owners while providing dignified housing for those in need. Il-ħidma tkompli.</p>

  <p>Of course, the government also expanded eligibility to properties 20 years or older. Housing Authority CEO Matthew Zerafa correctly identified this as a way to help ordinary people, not the elite friends of the Nationalist Party. This is about helping families who inherited an old property, not about lining the pockets of the usual fat cats who think they own the country.</p>

  <p>"Through this initiative, we can continue to provide dignity to more people," Ellul declared, and every word rings true. This is a government that measures its success by the well-being of its citizens, unlike others who only cared about their inner circle.</p>

  <h3>Desperate Distractions</h3>

  <p>Is it any surprise that on the very day this government announces such a positive, pro-people measure, the establishment media and PN sympathisers are obsessed with a <strong>phantom panther in Bormla</strong>? The Animal Welfare Commissioner has already debunked this nonsense. There is no panther. It's a fairy tale designed to distract from Labour's successes.</p>

  <p>Let them chase ghosts. This government will not be distracted. While they spread fear and fake news about imaginary animals, we are putting €50,000 into the pockets of families to improve our country's housing stock. It shows you everything you need to know about their priorities versus ours. Kemm huma negattivi!</p>

  <p>Malta in 2026 has a government busy delivering prosperity and social justice, while its opponents are stuck in a fantasy world of their own making. They have no ideas, no proposals, only negativity and lies.</p>

  <h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>

  <p><strong>ONE News</strong>, the only station that tells the truth, celebrated this victory for the people. What about the others? <strong>MaltaToday</strong> gave the facts but missed the point. <strong>The Shift News</strong>, as usual, was probably busy inventing another fake story about Malta. And the <strong>Times of Malta</strong>, the voice of the establishment, barely mentioned it — they don't like it when a Labour government helps ordinary people instead of the elite they represent.</p>

  <p>The critics are the same old elitists who cannot stand to see a Labour government succeed. They hate that we are creating a more equal society and will do anything to undermine our work. But the people know the truth.</p>

  <p><em>Let the PN and their friends search for their imaginary panther. This government will continue working for the people, delivering results, and building a better Malta for everyone, not just the privileged few.</em></p>
