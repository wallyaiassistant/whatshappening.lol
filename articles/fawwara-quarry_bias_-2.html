        SIĠĠIEWI – This is what institutional capture looks like. The Planning Authority — stacked with government appointees — has <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the expansion of the Fawwara quarry</a>, handing a fresh 10-year permit to operators the Court of Appeal ordered evicted. Let that sink in: the judiciary said "illegal occupation," and the PA said "here's another decade."

        But should we really be surprised? This is the same Labour government that turned the PA into an approval machine for well-connected developers. Remember when they promised transparency? When they said the institutions were working? L-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu — yes, working overtime to serve the chosen few.

        The quarry is co-owned by Charles Polidano — Iċ-Ċaqnu — a developer whose relationship with Labour-era planning decisions could fill a PhD thesis. The Ġebel Ciantar land was given to farmers in 1933. Ninety-three years of agricultural heritage, wiped out so connected operators can extract stone. This is what "il-gvern tal-aqwa żmien" looks like for Malta's countryside.

        The PA case officer's report is a masterclass in selective blindness: approval recommended because excavation would "ultimately be followed by site rehabilitation." Not a single mention of the court's eviction order. Not one word. This isn't oversight — this is deliberate erasure. The kind of institutional rot that set in after 2013 and has only deepened under Abela.

        Three tumoli of farmland gone. The Siġġiewi council objected — ignored. Civil society objected — ignored. The Court of Appeal ruled twice — ignored. And the Lands Authority, which spent years in court winning this case, didn't even show up to object. Kemm kellhom wiċċ! The agency tasked with protecting public land essentially handed the keys to the quarry operators.

        This is what happens when you have a government that treats public institutions as extensions of party headquarters. The PA rubber-stamps, the Lands Authority looks away, and the media — Times of Malta, MaltaToday, ONE News — maintains a convenient silence. Only The Shift had the courage to report it.

        Under the PN, Malta joined the EU precisely to build institutional safeguards like these. Independent courts, enforcement mechanisms, the rule of law. Labour has spent a decade dismantling them. X'pajjiż dan — where a court order means nothing, public land belongs to whoever digs first, and the government's Planning Authority serves everyone except the public.
