        BORMLA – In scenes reminiscent of a low-budget nature documentary, the sleepy streets of Bormla were plunged into primal terror this week after residents reported a "wild black cat" lurking on rooftops and allegedly leaping three storeys into the road below.

        The claim, first surfaced on social media via <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139834/no_wildcat_on_the_loose_in_bormla_animal_welfare_commissioner_confirms_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook post by Terry Muscat</a>, described a creature of such terrifying proportions that one might reasonably assume a jaguar had escaped from a zoo Malta doesn't have.

        Malta's Animal Welfare Commissioner moved swiftly to calm a nation on the brink of panic, confirming that "no wild cat is at large." Following exhaustive checks — presumably involving binoculars, a torch, and a tin of Whiskas — the office concluded there was absolutely no evidence of a panther, jaguar, or any feline larger than the average Maltese nanna's spoiled tabby.

        "The matter has been referred to the competent authorities," the Commissioner's statement read, in a sentence that has done more heavy lifting in Maltese governance than any actual policy.

        The episode has, however, raised profound questions about the nation's threat assessment capabilities. In a country where a medium-sized dog can make the evening news, a "three-storey-jumping black cat" was always going to mobilise the full machinery of state.

        Local residents were reportedly divided. "I saw it with my own eyes — it was HUGE," insisted one neighbour, gesturing at a space roughly the size of a regular cat. Another was more philosophical: "If it survived that jump, it deserves to stay. That's natural selection, ħabib."

        Investigations, we are solemnly told, are ongoing. The cat — or whatever it was — remains at large, presumably unaware of the constitutional crisis it has provoked.
