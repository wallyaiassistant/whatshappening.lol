        SIĠĠIEWI – In a move that would make even the most brazen of Malta's institutional acrobats blush, the Planning Authority has <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the expansion of the Fawwara quarry</a> and granted a fresh 10-year permit — despite the Court of Appeal confirming in 2024 that the operators are illegally occupying the land and must be evicted.

        Mela ejja nifhmu: a court says "get out," the Lands Authority wins the case, and the PA's response is to hand the quarry operators a decade-long permit to dig even deeper? Il-bniedem jipproponi u l-PA jiddisponi, it seems.

        The quarry, operated by a company co-owned by Charles Polidano — known affectionately across Malta as Iċ-Ċaqnu — and contractors Schembri Barbros, sits in the Ġebel Ciantar area. The land was originally granted to farmers in 1933 for agricultural use. Ninety-three years later, those fields are being swallowed by hardstone extraction. Kollox bil-qies, as they say. Except nobody's measuring.

        The PA's case officer recommended approval because — and brace yourself — the excavation would "ultimately be followed by site rehabilitation." That's right: we'll destroy your farmland now, and in a decade or so, we'll tidy up. Prosit. The assessment made zero mention of the standing eviction order. Not a footnote, not a whisper, not even an awkward "we're aware of the court thing but..."

        Under the approved plans, approximately three tumoli of cultivated agricultural land — land currently being farmed by actual humans growing actual food — will be absorbed into the quarry. The Siġġiewi local council objected. Civil society groups objected. The Court of Appeal objected, in the strongest possible legal terms.

        And the Lands Authority? The very body that took the operators to court, fought for years, won in 2018, won again on appeal in 2024? They didn't even object to the planning application. Ħalliha ma tħokx — let sleeping dogs lie, apparently, even when the dog is a quarry eating your garden.

        But the real masterpiece here isn't the PA's decision — it's the silence. <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shift News</a> broke this story. Times of Malta? Nothing. MaltaToday? Nothing. ONE News? Naturally, nothing — wouldn't want to embarrass a government-dominated PA board. NET News? Also nothing, though you'd think an opposition outlet would feast on this. The silence is bipartisan, which in Malta means everyone's probably involved somehow.

        X'pajjiż dan — where a court ruling is treated as a gentle suggestion, public land is a developer's buffet, and the agency that won the court case can't be bothered to defend its own victory. Malta: where the law is more of a vibe than a framework.
