  <h2>Alleged Money Launderer Runs Illegal Venue Opposite Police Academy — Nobody Notices</h2>

  <p>In what can only be described as Malta's finest contribution to situational comedy, an alleged money launderer named Adrian Muscat has been operating an <strong>illegal entertainment venue</strong> directly across the street from the Malta Police Force's training academy in Ta' Kandja, Siġġiewi. Mela, x'sar? The police cadets presumably practice their observation skills by staring at the exact opposite wall.</p>

  <p>According to a <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/alleged-money-launderer-adrian-muscat-owns-illegal-entertainment-venue-in-front-of-police-academy/" target="_blank">Shift News investigation</a>, Muscat — currently facing money laundering and car theft charges — developed what was supposed to be agricultural land into a full-blown entertainment complex complete with pool, kitchen, dining areas, and enough hard landscaping to make a developer weep with joy. His planning application to sanction the illegalities? <strong>Refused.</strong> His appeal? <strong>Rejected.</strong> The venue's status today? <strong>Fully operational, taking bookings, and promoting itself on social media.</strong></p>

  <p>Prosit. Il-bniedem jipproponi u Alla jiddisponi — except in this case, neither God nor the Planning Authority seem to be disposing of anything.</p>

  <h3>The Luxury Car "Accident"</h3>

  <p>But wait, there's more. State prosecutors also accuse Muscat of stealing three luxury vehicles from the Marriott Hotel in Balluta — an Audi S7, a Bentley Continental, and a Rolls Royce Ghost. His defence? He claims the vehicles, which were <em>removed using a tow truck</em>, were taken "accidentally." Because who among us hasn't accidentally tow-trucked a Rolls Royce out of a hotel car park? Jiġri, ħabib.</p>

  <p>A <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/owner-rollsroyce-testifies-car-dealer-stole-luxury-cars.1124287" target="_blank">Times of Malta report</a> notes the Rolls Royce owner testified in court. Meanwhile, prosecutors have requested a sweeping freezing order on Muscat's assets worth up to €1 million.</p>

  <h3>€2.5 Million in Direct Orders</h3>

  <p>Here's where kull ħaġa bil-qies goes completely out the window. Galletta Construction Ltd, a company <strong>entirely owned by Muscat</strong>, received 17 direct orders totalling €2.5 million in less than four years. Direct orders. Not tenders. Not competitive bids. Just "here, take this money" — the Maltese government's love language.</p>

  <h3>The Portal Silence</h3>

  <p>Now for the real entertainment: the portal coverage. <strong>The Shift News</strong> broke the story with aerial photos, site visits, and Planning Authority records. Investigative journalism at its finest.</p>

  <p>And the rest? As of this writing, <strong>ONE News</strong> — Labour's media arm — has published precisely nothing about an alleged money launderer operating an illegal venue while receiving millions in government direct orders. Surprise, surprise. <strong>NET News</strong> and <strong>TVM</strong> are equally silent. <strong>Times of Malta</strong> covered the car theft trial but hasn't touched the illegal venue angle.</p>

  <p>It's almost as if the story of a man with pending criminal charges receiving €2.5 million in direct government orders while running an illegal business across from a police academy isn't... newsworthy? Iva, sure.</p>

  <p>The police cadets in Ta' Kandja meanwhile continue their training, presumably learning the ancient art of looking the other way. It's a core module — three credits, no exam.</p>

  <p><em>Ta' Drinu Farmhouse is reportedly still accepting reservations. We recommend the irony — it's locally sourced and served fresh daily.</em></p>
