  <h2>Government Doubles Vacant Property Grants to €50K — Meanwhile, a Panther Roams Bormla</h2>

  <p>Parliamentary Secretary Andy Ellul has announced a significant boost for housing, confirming that the grant for rehabilitating vacant properties will <strong>double from €25,000 to €50,000</strong> this year. With broadened eligibility and streamlined bureaucracy, the Housing Authority is clearly stepping up efforts to bring more properties back onto the market.</p>

  <p>And in other news — somewhere in Bormla, a suspected panther is apparently still at large. But let's get back to the government's proactive work on housing.</p>

  <h3>A Boost for Housing Stock</h3>

  <p>As reported by <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139859/rehabilitation_of_vacant_dwellings_grant_to_double_to_50000_this_year" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a>, the scheme — the Rehabilitation of Vacant Dwellings for Rent Scheme — offers a clear incentive. If you own a property that's been vacant for over a year, the government provides up to €50,000 to fix it up. The property then joins the "Nikru biex Nassistu" social housing programme with a ten-year rental agreement, a win-win for both owners and those in need of housing.</p>

  <p>The eligibility has been expanded, with the property age requirement dropping from 30 to 20 years. Housing Authority CEO Matthew Zerafa rightly pointed out this helps "elderly individuals who own a holiday home" and "families who inherited an old property." It’s a practical step to unlock more housing, kull ħaġa b’sens.</p>

  <p>"Through this initiative, we can continue to provide dignity to more people," said Ellul, highlighting the social dimension of this important housing policy.</p>

  <h3>A Tale of Two Priorities</h3>

  <p>Now, here's a curious detail. This productive announcement came on the same day that authorities confirmed there is <strong>no wildcat on the loose in Bormla</strong> — despite some residents reporting sightings of a panther-like creature.</p>

  <p>The Animal Welfare Commissioner has clarified the situation, stating no such animal exists. While some Bormla residents remain unconvinced, it’s reassuring to see the government focused on concrete policy solutions rather than getting sidetracked by what seems to be a local mystery or rumour.</p>

  <p>Malta in February 2026: a government focused on delivering tangible housing solutions, while the public remains captivated by a feline fantasy. Priorities, ħabib. It's good to see the government has its own set correctly.</p>

  <h3>Media Coverage</h3>

  <p><strong>MaltaToday</strong> reported the housing grants factually, detailing the positive changes. <strong>ONE News</strong> rightfully covered the grants with warmth, celebrating a key policy that shows Labour delivering for families. <strong>The Shift News</strong>, focused on its own niche, missed the story. <strong>Times of Malta</strong> gave it a brief mention, though the significance of doubling the grant to €50,000 perhaps deserved more prominence.</p>

  <p>Nobody seemed to fully appreciate the government's commitment to tackling the vacant property issue head-on. But that's what we're here for.</p>

  <p><em>The Bormla panther may or may not exist, but the €50,000 grant for families is very real. And that’s what actually matters.</em></p>
