        VALLETTA – In a masterclass of unintentional comedy, the National Statistics Office announced today that <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139836/residential_building_permits_surge_by_over_half_at_the_end_of_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,487 new dwellings were approved</a> in the last quarter of 2025 — a staggering 54% increase over the same period the year before. Three-quarters of them are apartments. The average building permit now spawns 5.8 dwellings, because in Malta, a "building permit" is really just a licence to stack humans vertically.

        Santa Venera leads the charge with 263 approved new dwellings, followed by Qormi (197), Birkirkara (188), St Julian's (180), and Mosta (157). The Northern Harbour district alone accounts for 1,276 units — nearly as many as the entire population of Mdina, which, in fairness, is the only place left where you can see the sky without craning your neck past a crane.

        But here's where the poetry begins. On the very same day the NSO was celebrating Malta's concrete renaissance, the Constitutional Court <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered the State to pay €254,000</a> to the owners of a prime Republic Street property that the Labour Party has been occupying as a club for <em>seventy years</em>. The annual rent? €604. The market rate? €44,000. That's not a lease, that's a hostage situation.

        Judge Francesco Depasquale found the owners' fundamental rights had been breached by what even the court called "infamous" rent laws. But here's the chef's kiss: Labour can't be evicted because in 2004, the Valletta PL committee <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought a 4% share</a> of the property — making them co-owners. You can't evict someone from a building they technically own 4% of. Kull ħaġa bil-qies.

        The PN, predictably, pounced: "Labour grabs, and the people pay." Labour's response? "We respect the Court's decisions" followed immediately by "the PN should examine its own finances." Ah, the classic Maltese defence: "Yes, we've been squatting for 70 years, but have you seen YOUR accounting?"

        Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/Everyday-we-see-the-encouragement-of-property-speculation-ADPD-says-6736287358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADPD warned</a> that the government's Vision 2050 is "based on destructive growth," and <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/maltas-waste-management-is-going-in-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shift News reported</a> that Malta's waste management is going in reverse — because when you approve 3,487 new homes in three months, someone has to deal with 3,487 new bins. And a <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139844/appeal_lodged_against_two_14storey_hotels_in_tassliema_upheld_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-storey hotel development in Sliema</a> just had its permit overturned on appeal, proving that even Malta's planning system occasionally looks in the mirror and flinches.

        ONE News, naturally, found none of this newsworthy. When your own party is paying €50 a month for prime Valletta real estate while approving 3,487 new flats for everyone else, perhaps silence really is golden.
