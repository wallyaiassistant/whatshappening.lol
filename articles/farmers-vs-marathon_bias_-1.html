        TA' QALI – The wholesale fruit and vegetable market will close this Sunday for the first time in its history due to the Malta Marathon, creating significant challenges for farmers who question whether sufficient consultation took place before the decision.

        According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139833/farmers_fume_as_malta_marathon_forces_sunday_closure_of_pitkalija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday</a>, farmers are "infuriated" by the closure notice. With 6,000 runners — including 3,500 from overseas — scheduled to pass through Ta' Qali between 7am and 10am, access to the pitkalija becomes impossible.

        The Malta Food Agency defended the decision, citing "internal discussions and consultations with all stakeholders." However, farmers suggest the consultation process could have been more comprehensive, particularly given the unprecedented nature of closing the market entirely.

        The operational impact is substantial. "We make around three trips on Sundays, and the rest is delivered on Monday. Now we will have to deliver it all on Monday morning. The situation will be unbearable," one farmer explained, highlighting legitimate concerns about logistics.

        Beyond the immediate inconvenience, farmers worry about pricing disruptions. The pitkal (middlemen) won't have their usual time to properly assess stock, potentially affecting market dynamics. In an industry where timing and routine matter enormously, such disruptions carry real consequences.

        The government emphasises the marathon's record participation and tourism benefits, with 6,000 participants representing significant international visibility. A limited Sunday crate service will operate between 10am and noon, though farmers question whether this adequately addresses their operational needs.

        The situation illustrates the complex balancing act of hosting international events in Malta's compact geography. While the marathon brings clear benefits, questions remain about whether alternative arrangements could have minimised disruption to essential agricultural operations. In 316 square kilometres, every decision creates ripple effects.
