        BUĠIBBA – Here we go again. Another developer, another public foreshore, another Labour-era planning application that treats government land like a personal playground. Stephen Bonnici's Islet Fantasy Funpark has <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/planning/139803/developer_declares_public_ownership_on_land_earmarked_for_buibba_lido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resubmitted plans</a> for a lido on public coastline — after withdrawing a previous application that falsely declared the land wasn't government-owned.

        Let that sink in. A developer filed a planning application lying about land ownership. Got caught. Withdrew the application. And was allowed to simply refile with corrected details. No penalty. No investigation. No fraud referral. This is the planning culture Labour has cultivated since 2013: developers face zero consequences for pushing boundaries because the system rewards audacity.

        The site was natural rocky foreshore until 2004. Concrete appeared around 2008 — nobody knows who authorised it. A seasonal children's park permit from 2004 has now been leveraged into a year-round restaurant-pool-lido complex. This is the Labour development playbook: establish a foothold, normalise it, then escalate. Ħabib, it's not incompetence — it's strategy.

        The St Paul's Bay council, Moviment Graffitti, and Din l-Art Ħelwa all objected. The council's own architect warned the site is inaccessible with no public road connection. But when has local opposition ever stopped a Labour-era PA? Kemm kellhom wiċċ to talk about "stakeholder consultation" when they override every stakeholder that disagrees.

        Under the PN, Malta at least maintained the pretence that foreshore protection meant something. "Safeguarded area" designations were implemented specifically to prevent this kind of commercial creep. Labour has turned those designations into historical curiosities — quaint policy artifacts from a time when planning meant something beyond rubber-stamping developer wish lists.

        Bonnici's company owns Popeye Village — a 1980 film set that became a permanent tourist attraction. The man understands better than anyone that in Malta, nothing is as permanent as a "temporary" structure. And under this government, he's been proven right again and again. Għandna bżonn gvern li jħares l-kosta — not one that sells it by the square metre.
