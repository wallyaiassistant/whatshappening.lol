        TA' QALI – In what's becoming a familiar pattern under this administration, another major decision has been made without proper consultation with those who'll bear the consequences. The pitkalija will close this Sunday for the Malta Marathon — the first time ever — leaving farmers to deal with the logistical nightmare.

        According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139833/farmers_fume_as_malta_marathon_forces_sunday_closure_of_pitkalija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday</a>, farmers are justifiably "infuriated" after being informed rather than consulted about the closure. The 6,000 marathon participants — 3,500 from overseas — will jog through Ta' Qali while Malta's agricultural sector scrambles to adapt.

        The Malta Food Agency claims "internal discussions and consultations with all stakeholders" took place. Yet somehow the actual farmers — you know, the stakeholders who'll be most affected — were left out of these discussions. This mirrors the government's approach to planning: announce first, manage the fallout later.

        "We make around three trips on Sundays, and the rest is delivered on Monday. Now we will have to deliver it all on Monday morning. The situation will be unbearable," one farmer explained, highlighting the cascade of problems this decision creates.

        The economic implications are serious. Farmers worry Monday's chaos will distort pricing as middlemen won't have proper time to assess stock. In an industry where margins are already tight and timing is critical, this kind of disruption can have lasting effects beyond one weekend.

        While attracting international events is positive for Malta, the execution here raises questions about priorities and planning. "Security reasons" justify the closure, but couldn't alternative arrangements have been explored? The limited Sunday service (10am-noon) feels like an afterthought, not a solution.

        This encapsulates a broader pattern: big announcements for photo opportunities while the nuts and bolts of implementation get botched. Malta's agricultural sector deserves better coordination than being an afterthought to marathon logistics. In a 316-square-kilometre country, surely we can run events without paralysing essential services.
