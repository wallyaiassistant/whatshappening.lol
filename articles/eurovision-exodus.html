        VALLETTA – In what may be the largest coordinated act of cultural defiance since someone first suggested Malta should sing in English at Eurovision, over 150 Maltese artists have <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/malta-withdraw-eurovision-culture-minister-pbs-ceo-told-letter.1124296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written to Culture Minister Owen Bonnici and PBS CEO Charles Dalli</a> demanding Malta withdraw from Eurovision 2026 if Israel is allowed to participate.

        The letter, sent ahead of Saturday's "Malta: No Music for Genocide" protest outside Parliament, argues that Eurovision already set a precedent by barring Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The signatories — musicians, actors, filmmakers, theatre directors — say it's time Malta acted "with courage and conscience."

        The endorsement list reads like a who's who of Maltese public life: former President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, MGRM, human rights organisations, and a workers' union. <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/arts/music/139840/over_150_artists_cultural_workers_call_on_government_to_withdraw_eurovision_participation_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday reports</a> the campaign wants Malta to join Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and Iceland — countries that have already withdrawn.

        The irony is thicker than a Gozitan ftira. Culture Minister Owen Bonnici — the same man who <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week proposed "cultural leave"</a> for festa volunteers because our intangible heritage is so precious — now faces a choice between protecting cultural heritage (our Eurovision spot) and cultural conscience (not sharing a stage with what the UN has called genocide).

        But the real showstopper? ONE News. The Labour Party's media wing, which <a href="https://one.com.mt/il-kumitat-olimpiku-izraeljan-qed-jistenna-apologija-mit-tv-zvizzera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happily reported</a> on the Israeli Olympic Committee demanding an apology from Swiss TV, has maintained a cathedral-like silence on 150 Maltese artists demanding their own government withdraw from Eurovision. A protest endorsed by a former Labour President, no less.

        Mela x'sar? When Russia invaded Ukraine, Eurovision acted in weeks. When Israel does what the UN calls genocide, we get "postponed votes" and "ongoing discussions." And when 150 of your own artists demand action, apparently you get... nothing on ONE News.

            <blockquote>"Sure — that will tell Netanyahu… Eurovision is a joke not a sanctionable commodity. As long as the water we drink involves Israeli desalination patents… we are funding their economy and war machine, as are many arid Muslim countries. Are we ready to go without water? So let's not do the window dressing. It's shallow, performative and only helps us feel better and not at all the poor souls in Gaza. Grow up."</blockquote>
