        VALLETTA – Labour MEP Daniel Attard has struck again with what can only be described as the most shameless vote-buying scheme disguised as "cultural policy" in EU history: extra leave days for festa and carnival volunteers. Because when your party's facing corruption scandals, nothing works like promising people more holidays. Kemm għandhom wiċċ!

        This latest populist masterstroke, floated in the European Parliament, argues that volunteers are "the backbone of our intangible cultural heritage." Really? The backbone of Labour's strategy is clearly buying loyalty one festa at a time. Il-gvern qed jaħdem — at staying in power through handouts.

        Culture Minister Owen Bonnici, Labour's chief panderer-in-residence, <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Times of Malta</a> the government is "exploring" this brilliant idea for public sector workers. Because apparently, Malta's bloated public sector needs more reasons to stay home while the private sector carries the load.

        The absurdity peaks when Bonnici tries to explain why festa volunteers deserve special treatment but "many hobbyists" don't. Here's a thought: maybe because festa volunteers vote in clusters, while model train enthusiasts don't deliver entire villages to Labour? This isn't cultural policy — it's electoral mathematics with a Band Club soundtrack.

        Currently, public sector workers already enjoy generous leave for "cultural events abroad." Now Labour wants to extend this to every village procession and carnival float. Your tax euros at work: funding a permanent festa season where government employees are perpetually on "cultural leave."

        The timing perfectly encapsulates Labour's governance philosophy: while the IMF warns about Malta's <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139848/governments_current_labour_migration_approach_a_panicked_directionless_reaction_pn_says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"panicked and directionless"</a> labour strategy and productivity stagnates, Labour's solution is literally more time off work. This is the party that brought you Vitals Healthcare fraud, Panama Papers cronies, and now... festa leave. Mela veru!

        Malta already exceeds EU minimum leave requirements, yet Labour insists on piling on more holidays. But hey, when you've made a career of promising something for nothing, why stop now? The PN built EU membership; Labour built a nation of professional festa volunteers. Il-Maltin jafu x'għandhom jagħmlu come election time.
