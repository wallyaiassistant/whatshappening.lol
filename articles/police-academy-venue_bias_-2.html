  <h2>Alleged Money Launderer Runs Illegal Venue Opposite Police Academy — Nobody Notices</h2>

  <p>In what highlights serious concerns about institutional oversight, an alleged money launderer named Adrian Muscat has been operating an <strong>illegal entertainment venue</strong> directly across from the Malta Police Force's training academy in Ta' Kandja, Siġġiewi. The location raises uncomfortable questions about how such brazen illegalities can flourish under the noses of law enforcement. Mela, x'sar ma' l-kontrolli? The symbolism alone should trouble any government serious about rule of law.</p>

  <p>According to a <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/alleged-money-launderer-adrian-muscat-owns-illegal-entertainment-venue-in-front-of-police-academy/" target="_blank">Shift News investigation</a>, Muscat — currently facing serious money laundering and car theft charges — converted agricultural land into an entertainment complex complete with pool, kitchen, dining areas, and extensive illegal development. His planning application? <strong>Refused.</strong> His appeal? <strong>Rejected.</strong> The venue today? <strong>Still fully operational.</strong> This pattern of flouting planning laws with apparent impunity has become disturbingly familiar under Labour's watch.</p>

  <p>One can't help but remember the Vitals scandal, the 17 Black revelations, and numerous other cases where proper oversight seemed mysteriously absent. Il-bniedem jipproponi u l-gvern... jgħaddi l-vista l-oħra?</p>

  <h3>The Luxury Car Question</h3>

  <p>The charges against Muscat extend beyond planning violations. State prosecutors accuse him of stealing three luxury vehicles from the Marriott Hotel — an Audi S7, Bentley Continental, and Rolls Royce Ghost. His explanation that these vehicles were "accidentally" removed by tow truck strains credibility. Such serious allegations deserve thorough investigation, particularly given the timing with his planning violations.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/owner-rollsroyce-testifies-car-dealer-stole-luxury-cars.1124287" target="_blank">Times of Malta report</a> documents the Rolls Royce owner's testimony, while prosecutors seek to freeze €1 million in assets. But will justice be served, or will this be another case that mysteriously fades away?</p>

  <h3>€2.5 Million in Direct Orders</h3>

  <p>Perhaps most concerning is that Galletta Construction Ltd, <strong>entirely owned by Muscat</strong>, received 17 direct orders worth €2.5 million in under four years. Direct orders to a company owned by someone facing criminal charges raises serious questions about government procurement practices. Yes, but remember when PN governments were criticized for their tender processes? Well, at least they had competitive tenders to criticize.</p>

  <p>This pattern of direct orders to controversial figures has become a recurring theme, from roadworks to hospitals to major infrastructure. Kull ħaġa bil-qies has given way to kull ħaġa bil-ħajr tal-partit.</p>

  <h3>Selective Media Coverage</h3>

  <p><strong>The Shift News</strong> deserves credit for thorough investigative work, providing aerial photos and documentation that brought this story to light. This is journalism serving the public interest.</p>

  <p>However, the silence from other outlets is telling. <strong>ONE News</strong> — which never misses a chance to attack Opposition figures — has published nothing about an alleged money launderer receiving millions in government contracts. <strong>TVM</strong> and <strong>NET News</strong> have also remained quiet on this angle. Even <strong>Times of Malta</strong>, while covering the court proceedings, hasn't explored the procurement questions.</p>

  <p>This selective reporting raises concerns about media independence and whether certain stories receive different treatment based on political sensitivities.</p>

  <p>The police cadets continue their training across the street, hopefully learning proper investigative techniques. One hopes their curriculum includes lessons on maintaining vigilance regardless of a case's political implications.</p>

  <p><em>Ta' Drinu Farmhouse reportedly continues operations while these questions remain unanswered. The irony would be delicious if the implications weren't so serious.</em></p>
