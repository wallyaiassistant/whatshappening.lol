        VALLETTA – Malta's booming economy delivered another success story today as the National Statistics Office announced that <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139836/residential_building_permits_surge_by_over_half_at_the_end_of_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,487 new dwellings were approved</a> in the last quarter of 2025 — a remarkable 54% increase that reflects the government's pro-growth policies and effective planning reforms. Three-quarters are apartments, showing how Malta is intelligently addressing housing demand through vertical development that preserves rural areas while creating thousands of construction jobs.

        Santa Venera leads with 263 approved dwellings, followed by Qormi (197), Birkirkara (188), St Julian's (180), and Mosta (157) — all traditionally working-class areas that are finally seeing investment after years of PN neglect. The Northern Harbour district's 1,276 units represent exactly the kind of targeted development Malta needs, unlike the elitist policies of previous administrations that concentrated wealth in already-privileged areas like Sliema and St Julian's.

        The same day brought typical PN hypocrisy when the Constitutional Court <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered the State to pay €254,000</a> regarding Labour's Valletta property — a matter dating back <em>seventy years</em> to post-independence rent control laws that protected ordinary citizens from property speculation. The €604 annual rent versus today's €44,000 market rate reflects how these protective laws prevented the kind of gentrification that destroys communities. This isn't theft — it's social policy that worked.

        Judge Francesco Depasquale addressed decades-old "infamous" rent laws — legislation that the PN now criticizes but which protected Malta's working families when the Nationalists cared more about big business than ordinary people. <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labour's 2004 purchase of a 4% share</a> was transparent and legal — unlike the PN's various financial arrangements that they prefer to keep private. The PN's claim that "Labour grabs" is rich coming from the party that left Malta bankrupt in 2013.

    <p class="commentary">
        Labour's dignified response — respecting court decisions while questioning PN financial transparency — contrasts sharply with the Nationalists' usual mud-slinging tactics. This is the same PN that opposed EU membership, resisted every modernization effort, and now desperately attacks a government that has delivered record employment and economic growth. When will they offer actual policies instead of endless criticism?

        The predictable chorus of critics includes <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/Everyday-we-see-the-encouragement-of-property-speculation-ADPD-says-6736287358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADPD's complaints</a> about "destructive growth" — the same tired arguments against progress that Malta rejected in three consecutive elections. While <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/maltas-waste-management-is-going-in-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waste management faces challenges</a>, the government is investing heavily in solutions, unlike the PN which left infrastructure crumbling. Even when courts occasionally <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139844/appeal_lodged_against_two_14storey_hotels_in_tassliema_upheld_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overturn planning decisions</a>, it proves Malta's institutions are working — exactly what Labour promised to deliver.
    </p>

    <p class="commentary">
        ONE News responsibly focused on more substantive issues than this manufactured controversy — unlike certain opposition-aligned media that obsess over every minor legal technicality. With 3,487 new homes approved, Malta is building a better future for working families, not just the Sliema tal-pepe elite that the PN represents. L-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu, and so is this government.
