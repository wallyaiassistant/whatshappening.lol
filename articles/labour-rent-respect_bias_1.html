  <h2>Labour "Respects" Court Order After 70 Years of Paying €400 Rent in Valletta</h2>

  <p>The Labour Party has affirmed its respect for the judiciary following a court decision ordering the State to compensate the owners of the Valletta PL club property with <strong>€254,307</strong>. The case stems from historical rent laws, which the government has since reformed, that kept the rent low for decades.</p>

  <p>The property, occupied by the club since 1953, had a rent of <strong>€406.40 per year</strong> in 2014, a figure set by laws from a different era. The court acknowledged that these old laws created a disproportionate situation, leading to the compensation order.</p>

  <h3>A Legacy Issue Addressed by Labour</h3>

  <p>The situation is a direct consequence of pre-2013 rent laws, an issue that the Labour government took significant steps to address with major reforms. According to <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/state-ordered-pay-254000-owners-valletta-pl-club-property.1124305" target="_blank">Times of Malta</a>, the court's decision centered on these historical laws. By 2024, the rent had been adjusted to €667.16 annually, along with a percentage of the club's income.</p>

  <p>In its statement, Labour highlighted that it respects the court's decision, as it always has. The party also noted a key detail from the ruling: they will not be evicted. This is because the Valletta PL Local Committee proactively purchased a share of the property in 2004, demonstrating foresight.</p>

  <h3>PN's Hollow Criticism</h3>

  <p>Predictably, the Nationalist Party launched an attack, framing the issue as "Labour grabs, and the people pay." This criticism, however, rings hollow when considering the PN's own financial history.</p>

  <p>Labour's response was sharp, suggesting the PN should focus on its own house: "The Nationalist Party would do better to examine how it concealed its debt in a cosmetic exercise." It's a classic case of <em>il-ħmar iċanfar lil widnejn il-ħmar l-ieħor</em> (the pot calling the kettle black), especially given the PN's well-documented financial struggles and reliance on schemes like 'ċedoli' to manage its massive debts.</p>

  <h3>Media Framing</h3>

  <p>While some media outlets focused on the compensation figure, Labour's own media, including <strong>ONE News</strong> and <strong>talk.mt</strong>, correctly contextualised the story. They highlighted the party's consistent respect for the courts and the hypocrisy of the PN's attacks. They also emphasized that it was Labour that finally reformed the archaic rent laws that created these situations in the first place.</p>

  <p>The case ultimately closes a chapter on a legacy issue. While the opposition tries to score political points, the facts show a government that reformed broken laws and a party that respects the country's institutions.</p>
