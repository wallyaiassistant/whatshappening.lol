        BUĠIBBA – Another day, another fake outrage from the PN-aligned environmentalist lobby. Stephen Bonnici's company has <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/planning/139803/developer_declares_public_ownership_on_land_earmarked_for_buibba_lido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed plans</a> for a lido on an already-cemented platform in Buġibba — a concrete slab that's been there since 2008 — and you'd think he'd proposed bulldozing the Blue Grotto from the reaction.

        The ownership correction between applications? That's called doing things properly. Under the PN, developers didn't even bother declaring ownership — they just built. Remember the ODZ scandals? The swimming pools in Dingli? The villas in Għajnsielem? Kemm kellhom wiċċ to lecture anyone about planning propriety! At least this developer filed correctly, withdrew when there was an error, and resubmitted transparently.

        This is an 828-square-metre concrete platform. Not a sandy beach. Not a nature reserve. Concrete. Already there. Doing nothing. The proposal would create a restaurant, pool, and sunbed area — jobs for Maltese families in St Paul's Bay, revenue for the local economy, facilities for tourists. But no — Graffitti and Din l-Art Ħelwa would rather it sit there crumbling. Għandna bżonn xogħol, mhux protesti!

        The local council objects because of "access concerns." Meanwhile, their constituents are crying out for investment and employment. This is the same council that watched Buġibba deteriorate for years under PN neglect. Now Labour is attracting investment and suddenly it's a problem? The hypocrisy is breathtaking.

        Bonnici runs Popeye Village — a beloved institution that employs dozens and delights thousands. His track record speaks for itself. Under this government, entrepreneurs are encouraged to invest and create. Dak iż-żmien, under the PN, Malta was a dead zone where businesses closed and young people left. Now we're arguing about too MUCH investment? We should be so lucky.

        Let the PA assess the application on its merits. Let the experts decide, not the professional protesters. Malta's tourism sector needs investment, Buġibba needs facilities, and this concrete platform needs a purpose. Il-gvern qed jaħdem — and the PN can keep whining from the sidelines.
