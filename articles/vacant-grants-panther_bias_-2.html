  <h2>Government Doubles Vacant Property Grants to €50K — Meanwhile, a Panther Roams Bormla</h2>

  <p>Parliamentary Secretary Andy Ellul has announced that the grant for rehabilitating vacant properties will <strong>double from €25,000 to €50,000</strong> this year — another expensive attempt to address a housing crisis that this same government helped create through years of unchecked development. The Housing Authority projects competence while Maltese families struggle with skyrocketing rents and property prices that have spiraled completely out of control.</p>

  <p>Speaking of control — somewhere in Bormla, residents continue reporting panther sightings while authorities seem unable to provide clear answers. Just another example of this administration's questionable grip on basic governance. Mela x'se nagħmlu?</p>

  <h3>Expensive Solutions</h3>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139859/rehabilitation_of_vacant_dwellings_grant_to_double_to_50000_this_year" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a>, the scheme — the Rehabilitation of Vacant Dwellings for Rent Scheme — essentially uses taxpayer money to incentivize property owners to fix up vacant properties. While helping with housing stock sounds good in principle, one has to wonder why we need such generous public subsidies to address a problem largely created by this government's cozy relationship with developers.</p>

  <p>The age requirement has dropped from 30 to 20 years, which Housing Authority CEO Matthew Zerafa frames as helping "elderly individuals" and "families who inherited properties." Fair enough, but it's also another subsidy that ultimately benefits the property-owning class while renters continue getting squeezed. Kull ħin l-istess ruketta.</p>

  <p>"Through this initiative, we can continue to provide dignity to more people," said Ellul, though one might ask whether dignity wouldn't be better served by addressing the root causes of Malta's housing affordability crisis rather than throwing more taxpayer money at the symptoms.</p>

  <h3>Questions of Priorities</h3>

  <p>The timing is telling: this announcement came on the same day authorities were still scrambling to address resident concerns about a <strong>suspected panther in Bormla</strong>. The Animal Welfare Commissioner insists no such animal exists, but residents remain understandably concerned about their safety.</p>

  <p>It's a curious contrast — the government can quickly calculate generous property rehabilitation subsidies but struggles to provide clear, reassuring communication about potential public safety issues in residential areas. The panther situation might seem minor, but it reflects broader questions about this administration's responsiveness to citizen concerns.</p>

  <p>In Labour's Malta, we get swift action on property grants (which happen to align with developer interests) but muddled responses on issues that directly affect residents' peace of mind. The priorities speak for themselves, għax hekk hu.</p>

  <h3>Media Coverage</h3>

  <p><strong>MaltaToday</strong> covered the housing grants with their typical straightforward approach — facts presented without much critical analysis of the underlying policy questions. <strong>ONE News</strong> celebrated the announcement with predictable enthusiasm, framing it as "Labour delivering for families" without examining the broader context. <strong>The Shift News</strong> was busy with more pressing corruption investigations. <strong>Times of Malta</strong> gave it brief mention, treating housing policy as lifestyle content rather than serious economics.</p>

  <p>None bothered to question whether these expensive grants address housing affordability or simply subsidize property owners while fundamental problems persist. That kind of analysis requires asking uncomfortable questions about whose interests these policies really serve.</p>

  <p><em>The Bormla panther situation remains unresolved — much like many of the underlying issues these expensive grants are meant to address. At least the panther's probably not collecting subsidies.</em></p>
