  <p>The Labour Party has issued a statement saying it "respects the Court's decisions" regarding a Valletta property its club has occupied since 1953. The decision orders the State to pay <strong>€254,307</strong> in compensation to the property's owners, who were receiving a rent described by the court as "disproportionately" low.</p>

  <p>The numbers at the heart of the case are stark. In 2014, the Valletta Labour Club was paying just <strong>€406.40 per year</strong> for its prime location on Republic Street. This comes to €33.87 per month. Even by 2024, the annual rent had only risen to €667.16, a figure that pales in comparison to commercial rental values in the capital.</p>

  <h3>A Decades-Long Issue</h3>

  <p>According to the <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/state-ordered-pay-254000-owners-valletta-pl-club-property.1124305" target="_blank">Times of Malta</a> report, Judge Francesco Depasquale ruled that the old rent control laws, which allowed for such low payments, breached the owners' fundamental rights. The court found that for seven decades, the owners did not receive fair compensation for their property.</p>

  <p>The penalty of €254,307 will be paid by the State, meaning taxpayers will cover the cost. This has drawn criticism, with the PN highlighting that this payment adds to a recent <strong>€1.6 million</strong> in similar property-related penalties.</p>

  <h3>Political Reactions</h3>

  <p>Both parties have responded to the ruling. The PN stated, "Labour grabs, and the people pay," focusing on the use of public funds to settle the matter.</p>

  <p>Labour, in its response, pointed out that the court did not order an eviction. The party had purchased a small (4%) share of the property in 2004, making it a co-owner. They also deflected criticism by calling on the PN to "examine how it concealed its debt in a cosmetic exercise."</p>

  <h3>How the Media Saw It</h3>

  <p>Most news outlets, including <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank">The Malta Independent</a>, reported on the facts of the case and the reactions from both sides. Labour's media wing, ONE News and talk.mt, focused on the party's statement, emphasizing that they respect court decisions and pivoting to the PN's financial issues, while omitting mention of the human rights breach finding.</p>

  <p>The property's owners, who waited 70 years for a resolution, will receive the compensation. The case highlights the long-lasting and costly legacy of Malta's old rent laws.</p>
