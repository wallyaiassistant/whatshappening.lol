  <h2>The Night Labour Put Its Own Deputy Leader in Political Witness Protection</h2>

  <p>In the troubling annals of Labour's control-obsessed politics, few moves reveal the party's authoritarian instincts quite as clearly as the night they decided their own Deputy Leader, <strong>Anġlu Farrugia</strong>, was too risky to appear on television. This wasn't about political strategy — it was about silencing internal dissent before it could expose uncomfortable truths.</p>

  <p>As <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/on-the-busses-the-night-labour-hid-its-own-deputy/" target="_blank">The Shift News reveals</a>, the scene was Xarabank — where Labour's handlers couldn't stomach their own deputy potentially criticising the party's increasingly cozy relationships with developers and business interests. Their cynical solution? Deploy the volatile <strong>Franco Debono</strong> as a human hand grenade to blow up any possibility of substantive debate. X'tistenna minn dawn?</p>

  <p>This incident perfectly encapsulates Labour's approach to political discourse: when you can't control the narrative, destroy the platform.</p>

  <h3>The Calculated Chaos</h3>

  <p>What followed was textbook Labour manipulation. The show imploded into chaos — exactly as intended. Police were called in — problem solved. Any risk of Farrugia exposing Labour's internal contradictions? Eliminated through orchestrated mayhem.</p>

  <p>The particularly cynical aspect here is how Labour managed to make the PN look unstable while simultaneously protecting their own dirty laundry. Classic misdirection: create the crisis, blame the opposition, walk away clean. Min ma jkunx jaf, ma jkunx jista' jitkellem.</p>

  <h3>The Twelve-Year Aftermath</h3>

  <p>What makes this story particularly damning is Franco Debono's subsequent <strong>twelve-year career</strong> of institutional disruption. Every parliamentary crisis, every constitutional standoff, every moment of democratic dysfunction can be traced back to Labour's decision to prioritise party control over democratic discourse.</p>

  <p>Labour knew exactly what they were unleashing, yet they did it anyway because protecting the party image mattered more than protecting democratic institutions.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Simon Busuttil</strong> — the only participant who actually came prepared for democratic debate — maintained his composure throughout the engineered chaos. Whatever you think of his politics, his behaviour that night demonstrated the kind of principled leadership Labour apparently feared from their own deputy.</p>

  <h3>The Propaganda Wall</h3>

  <p>The current media response to The Shift's exposé reveals Labour's ongoing control over information flow. This story should be front-page news on every portal — it's a documented case study of how the ruling party manipulates public discourse.</p>

  <p><strong>ONE News?</strong> Complete silence. The Labour mouthpiece has no interest in revisiting the party's manipulation tactics. <strong>NET News?</strong> Also quiet — perhaps because acknowledging Busuttil's dignified conduct doesn't fit their preferred narrative. <strong>talk.mt?</strong> Nothing. The Labour-leaning outlet apparently sees no news value in exposing how the party systematically controls optics at democracy's expense.</p>

  <p>This selective silence isn't just editorial choice — it's coordinated message management. The same pattern we see whenever Labour faces uncomfortable questions about transparency, accountability, or democratic norms.</p>

  <p><em>Anġlu Farrugia eventually became Speaker of the House — a move that conveniently removed any potential for future internal dissent while giving him a prestigious title. Labour's message to internal critics remains clear: toe the line or be sidelined, however elegantly.</em></p>
