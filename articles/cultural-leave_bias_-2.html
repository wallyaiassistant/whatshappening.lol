        VALLETTA – In a country where the village festa is essentially a second religion, Labour MEP Daniel Attard has proposed what may be the most populist piece of EU legislation ever conceived: extra leave days for people who volunteer at feasts and carnival. Because nothing says "serious governance" like institutionalising more reasons to stay home from work.

        The proposal, floated in a report to the European Parliament's transport and tourism committee, argues that volunteers who build floats, make fireworks, and organise processions are "the backbone of our intangible cultural heritage" and should not have to burn through their holiday allowance to keep traditions alive. A noble sentiment, if somewhat disconnected from economic reality.

        Culture Minister Owen Bonnici, never missing a chance to pander to the grassroots, <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Times of Malta</a> the government is "exploring" the idea for public sector workers — though he cautioned this is "a broad discussion, since there are many hobbyists in the country."

        The phrase "many hobbyists" betrays the central absurdity here. If festa volunteers get special leave, why not amateur archaeologists? Weekend band players? People who collect vintage buses? Bonnici's attempt to draw arbitrary lines around cultural worthiness would be amusing if it weren't being funded by taxpayers.

        Currently, public sector workers can already take special leave when representing Malta at cultural events abroad. The proposal would extend this to local events — meaning your neighbour who spends three weeks decorating his street corner could theoretically claim official time off for community beautification.

        The timing is particularly tone-deaf: the same week the government is being hammered for its <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139848/governments_current_labour_migration_approach_a_panicked_directionless_reaction_pn_says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"panicked and directionless"</a> labour market strategy by both the PN and the IMF, Labour's solution is... more holidays. This is the kind of backwards thinking that has Malta's productivity lagging while the cost of living soars.
    </p>
    <p class="commentary">
        The EU's Working Time Directive mandates at least 20 days of paid annual leave. Malta already exceeds this. Adding "festa leave" to an already generous package suggests a government more interested in buying goodwill than building a competitive economy. Culture is precious, but so is a work ethic — something this proposal seems determined to undermine.
