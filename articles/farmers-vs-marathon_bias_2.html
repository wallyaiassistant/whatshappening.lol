        TA' QALI – While some farmers grumble about the pitkalija's first-ever Sunday closure, the bigger story is Malta's spectacular success in attracting a record 6,000 marathon participants — including 3,500 from overseas. This is what progress looks like under a government that puts Malta on the world map.

        According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139833/farmers_fume_as_malta_marathon_forces_sunday_closure_of_pitkalija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday</a>, some farmers are "infuriated" by one day's disruption. But let's be honest — could the previous administration have attracted 6,000 international runners? Their idea of tourism was hoping Air Malta wouldn't collapse.

        The Malta Food Agency demonstrated responsible governance through proper "internal discussions and consultations with all stakeholders." Unlike the chaos of previous administrations, this government actually plans ahead and coordinates complex logistics across multiple sectors.

        Yes, farmers will need to adjust Sunday deliveries to Monday morning — a temporary inconvenience for a massive economic boost. "The situation will be unbearable," one farmer complained, but thousands of tourists bringing millions in revenue might disagree. The government even arranged extended Monday hours and maintained Sunday crate service from 10am to noon.

        Some farmers worry about pricing chaos, but this reflects short-term thinking. The marathon generates hotel bookings, restaurant visits, and international media coverage worth far more than one morning's scheduling disruption. Malta's economy has thrived precisely because this government thinks beyond the traditional sectors.

        Remember when Malta struggled to attract major international events? Now we're turning them away. The marathon's record numbers prove Robert Abela's vision of Malta as a premier destination is working. "Security reasons" for the closure? That's called professional event management — something lacking in previous administrations.

        This perfectly captures Labour's Malta: thinking big, delivering results, and yes — occasionally asking sectors to coordinate for national success. Ta' Qali transformed from neglected wasteland into a multi-purpose hub hosting world-class events. In 316 square kilometres, maximizing every space requires vision — something this government has in abundance.
