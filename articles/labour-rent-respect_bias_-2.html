  <h2>Labour "Respects" Court Order After 70 Years of Paying €400 Rent in Valletta</h2>

  <p>The Labour Party has announced it "respects the Court's decisions, as it always does" — though it took a Constitutional Court ruling to force them to pay <strong>€254,307</strong> to property owners after seven decades of paying rent so low it defies economic reality. Since 1953, the Valletta Labour Club has occupied prime Republic Street real estate for what most people pay monthly for utilities.</p>

  <p>The numbers are staggering. In 2014, Labour was paying <strong>€406.40 per year</strong> for the property — that's €33.87 per month. In the heart of the capital. <em>Min jistħi jmut bil-ġuħ</em>, as they say, and Labour has mastered the art of shameless benefit extraction.</p>

  <h3>Constitutional Rights Violation</h3>

  <p>According to <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/state-ordered-pay-254000-owners-valletta-pl-club-property.1124305" target="_blank">Times of Malta</a>, Judge Francesco Depasquale found that rent control laws allowed "disproportionately" low payments that violated the owners' fundamental rights. By 2024, the "market" rent had climbed to €667.16 annually — still less than what most people pay for a premium gym membership.</p>

  <p>The Constitutional Court ruled this arrangement breached human rights. Seventy years of systematic undercompensation, sanctioned by law but morally indefensible. The property owners waited a lifetime for justice while a political party treated their inheritance like a subsidised clubhouse.</p>

  <h3>Taxpayer Liability</h3>

  <p>The €254,307 penalty comes from State coffers — meaning taxpayers foot the bill for Labour's decades of below-market occupation. This adds to Labour's recent <strong>€1.6 million</strong> in property-related penalties, creating a troubling pattern of public money compensating for the party's property dealings.</p>

  <p>Labour's defence strategy was predictable: deflect and attack. After noting they can't be evicted (having bought a 4% share in 2004, fifty years into their occupancy), they pivoted to attacking PN finances: "The Nationalist Party would do better to examine how it concealed its debt." <em>Il-ħmar qal lil-ħmar: kemm għandek widnejk kbar.</em></p>

  <h3>Media Response</h3>

  <p>Independent outlets like <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a> and the <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank">Malta Independent</a> provided balanced coverage. ONE News and talk.mt focused heavily on Labour's statement about "respecting courts" while downplaying the human rights violation and taxpayer liability.</p>

  <p>The property owners, after seven decades of below-market returns, plan to use their compensation to invest in property where they can charge fair rent. To tenants who negotiate in good faith rather than exploit historical legal loopholes.</p>

  <p>Questions remain about how many similar arrangements exist across Malta's political landscape — and how much more taxpayer money will be needed to correct decades of systematic undercompensation.</p>
