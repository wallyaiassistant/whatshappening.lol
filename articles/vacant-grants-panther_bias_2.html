  <h2>Government Doubles Vacant Property Grants to €50K — Meanwhile, a Panther Roams Bormla</h2>

  <p>In a major move to tackle the housing issue, Parliamentary Secretary Andy Ellul has announced that this Labour government is <strong>doubling the grant for rehabilitating vacant properties from a generous €25,000 to an incredible €50,000</strong> this year. This is another clear example of a government that listens and acts, with the Housing Authority delivering on the promise to get more empty houses turned into homes for our families. Ħidma li tħalli l-frott.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, some people are still talking about a panther in Bormla. But let's focus on what really matters: this government's commitment to social progress.</p>

  <h3>Delivering for Families</h3>

  <p>As <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139859/rehabilitation_of_vacant_dwellings_grant_to_double_to_50000_this_year" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a> reports, the scheme is a testament to social-democratic values. Owners of properties vacant for over a year get up to €50,000 to bring them up to standard, and in return, these homes provide much-needed social housing through the "Nikru biex Nassistu" programme. It's a smart, effective policy that helps everyone.</p>

  <p>Eligibility has been rightly expanded to include properties 20 years or older. As Housing Authority CEO Matthew Zerafa explained, this helps ordinary people like "elderly individuals who own a holiday home" and "families who inherited an old property." This is how you create real opportunities for people, mhux bħal oħrajn.</p>

  <p>"Through this initiative, we can continue to provide dignity to more people," said Ellul, and he's absolutely right. This isn't just about buildings; it's about giving people the secure and dignified housing they deserve.</p>

  <h3>Action, Not Distraction</h3>

  <p>It's amusing that on the same day the government announced this fantastic €50,000 grant, the conversation for some was about a <strong>supposed panther in Bormla</strong>. The authorities, including the Animal Welfare Commissioner, have made it clear: there is no panther. It’s a non-story.</p>

  <p>While some prefer to chase shadows and urban legends, this Labour government remains focused on the people's priorities. The contrast couldn't be clearer: a government delivering concrete results versus the background noise of gossip and fantasy.</p>

  <p>Malta in February 2026 is a nation on the move, with a government that can deliver a €50,000 boost for families while calmly and professionally handling bizarre distractions. Priorities are where they should be: with the people. Gvern li jwettaq.</p>

  <h3>How the Media Saw It</h3>

  <p><strong>MaltaToday</strong> reported the facts, as expected. <strong>ONE News</strong> rightfully celebrated this fantastic news, highlighting how Labour is once again delivering for the people. Predictably, <strong>The Shift News</strong> was silent, preferring to focus on its usual negative agenda rather than acknowledge positive developments. <strong>Times of Malta</strong> gave it a brief mention, failing to grasp the significance of such a substantial investment in social housing.</p>

  <p>It’s a shame some outlets can’t bring themselves to celebrate good news for the country. Thankfully, the results speak for themselves.</p>

  <p><em>So, while some look for imaginary panthers, this government is busy building a better and more just society for everyone. The choice is clear.</em></p>
