  <h2>Marmarà Poll Shows Labour Lead Shrinking But Nobody Panic</h2>

  <p>Vincent Marmarà has once again confirmed what we all know: the Maltese people trust Labour to continue governing this country, and no amount of PN desperation can change that reality. While the blue media celebrates an 8.6% gap as some kind of comeback story, the numbers tell the real truth — Labour still commands a massive 25,000-29,000 vote advantage. The so-called "shrinking" from 39,000 in 2022? That was an exceptional landslide that any party would be proud of. Il-gvern qed jaħdem, and the people know it.</p>

  <p>Robert Abela towers over Alex Borg at 44.4% preferred PM versus a pathetic 34.7% — and this after years of PN propaganda and their elitist friends in certain media outlets doing everything to undermine our democratically elected government. Both leaders have 86% internal support, but there's a world of difference: Abela's supporters back a leader delivering jobs, infrastructure, and progress. Borg's supporters are still living in the past, dreaming of the days when the PN left this country broke and divided.</p>

  <p>The 11.8% "uncommitted" voters aren't confused — they're comfortable. When you've got record employment, economic growth, and social progress, some people don't feel the urgency they felt when the PN was destroying everything good about Malta. The 5.8% of 2022 Labour voters who might not vote? They're satisfied customers, not defectors. Kemm kellhom wiċċ the PN to spin this as bad news for Labour!</p>

  <p>Every survey confirms the same devastating reality for the PN: they're stuck at 44%, the same ceiling they've had since the people threw them out in 2013. Three elections, three defeats, and they still can't break through because Malta remembers dak żmien when they left us in ruins. Labour's numbers vary only slightly across polls because our support is rock solid. The 5.5-point average gap? That's a landslide in any normal country. Third parties at 5.7%? Let them play their games — real politics is about governing, not grandstanding.</p>

  <p>Marmarà says "barring major events" nothing changes, but he misses the point entirely. The major event already happened: Labour transformed this country from the basket case the PN left behind into the European success story we are today. The PN had their chance, they failed spectacularly, and the people won't forget. The real question isn't whether Labour wins the next election — it's whether the PN will finally accept that Maltese democracy has spoken, repeatedly and decisively.
