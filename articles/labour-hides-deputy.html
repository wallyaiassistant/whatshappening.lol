  <h2>The Night Labour Put Its Own Deputy Leader in Political Witness Protection</h2>

  <p>In the annals of Maltese political strategy, few moves have aged quite as beautifully as the night Labour decided its own Deputy Leader, <strong>Anġlu Farrugia</strong>, was too dangerous to be allowed on television. Not dangerous in the "revolutionary firebrand" sense. Dangerous in the "might accidentally tell the truth about how he feels" sense.</p>

  <p>As <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/on-the-busses-the-night-labour-hid-its-own-deputy/" target="_blank">The Shift News recalls</a>, the scene was Xarabank — Malta's equivalent of gladiatorial combat but with worse lighting. The plan was simple: Labour's deputy leader debates PN's newly anointed deputy, Simon Busuttil. One problem — Anġlu wasn't exactly bursting with enthusiasm for Labour's accelerating love affair with big business, developers, and freshly polished boardroom alliances.</p>

  <p>So what did Labour's strategists do? They deployed <strong>Franco Debono</strong>. Il-kanun magħmul biex jitħares — but in this case, the cannon was aimed squarely at the debate itself.</p>

  <h3>The Xarabank Implosion</h3>

  <p>What followed was pure Maltese political opera. The show collapsed into chaos. Police were called. The debate evaporated like a minister's promise after election day. And Labour's potentially awkward internal tensions? Drowned in spectacle. <em>Mission accomplished.</em></p>

  <p>The added bonus — and Labour's strategists surely appreciated this — was that the whole mess made it look like the PN was having internal conniptions. Debono, then still nominally a PN rebel, provided the perfect cover. "Mhux jien kien — look at the other lot!"</p>

  <h3>The Twelve-Year Encore</h3>

  <p>Here's the part that elevates this from political manoeuvre to modern art: Franco Debono proceeded to spend the next <strong>twelve years</strong> proving that the volatility wasn't a one-off performance but a <em>lifestyle commitment</em>. Governments, oppositions, institutions, personalities, reforms, conspiracies — nothing was safe from the Debono treatment. Always aggrieved. Always animated. Always centre-stage. Min iħobb il-baħar, iħobb l-imwieġ.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Shift piece notes, Simon Busuttil was the only person that night who showed up for an actual debate. He didn't exploit the circus. He didn't escalate. He just stood there, waiting for a discussion that Labour had no intention of allowing. You may disagree with the man politically, but on that night, he looked like the only adult in the room.</p>

  <h3>The Silent Treatment</h3>

  <p>And here's where the portal coverage becomes delicious. The Shift published this retrospective piece — essentially a surgical examination of Labour's "control the optics, neutralise the inconvenient" playbook.</p>

  <p><strong>ONE News?</strong> Nothing. Zero. Xejn. The Labour media organ has no interest in revisiting the time the party treated its own deputy leader like a liability to be managed rather than a colleague to be supported. <strong>NET News?</strong> Also quiet — perhaps because this particular piece paints Busuttil in a flattering light and they'd rather not remind anyone he exists. <strong>talk.mt?</strong> Silence. The Labour-leaning outlet apparently doesn't find it newsworthy that the party has a documented history of hiding inconvenient people from cameras.</p>

  <p>Only The Shift had the stomach for it. Investigative journalism isn't just about the present — sometimes it's about the patterns that keep repeating.</p>

  <p><em>Anġlu Farrugia, for his part, went on to become Speaker of the House. Whether this was a promotion or a more permanent form of the same witness protection programme is left as an exercise for the reader.</em></p>
