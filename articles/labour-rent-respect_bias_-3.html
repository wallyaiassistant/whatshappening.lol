  <h2>Labour "Respects" Court Order After 70 Years of Paying €400 Rent in Valletta</h2>

  <p>The Labour Party — the same outfit that brought you the Panama Papers, Vitals, and a golden passport scheme for oligarchs — has once again been caught with its hands in someone else's cookie jar. This time, a Constitutional Court has ruled they must pay <strong>€254,307</strong> to property owners after <em>seventy years</em> of what can only be described as institutionalised theft.</p>

  <p>Since 1953, Labour has been squatting — yes, <em>squatting</em> — in a prime Republic Street property for the princely sum of <strong>€406.40 per year</strong>. That's €33.87 per month. For comparison, most Maltese families pay more for their mobile phone plan. <em>Ħarami jibqa' ħarami</em> — and this is theft dressed up in legal jargon.</p>

  <h3>Taxpayers Pick Up the Bill (Again)</h3>

  <p>The Constitutional Court didn't mince words: this arrangement violated the property owners' <strong>fundamental human rights</strong>. Seventy years of rights violations. Seventy years of a political party enriching itself at private citizens' expense. And who pays the €254,307 penalty? Not Labour. <em>You do.</em> The taxpayers.</p>

  <p>This follows Labour's <strong>€1.6 million</strong> in recent property-related penalties — all from the public purse. Il-flus tax-xagħar tal-poplu għal ħajr ta' politiċi ħwejjeġ. From Vitals to the ITS to phantom hospitals, Labour's pattern is crystal clear: take what doesn't belong to you, then make the people pay when you get caught.</p>

  <h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>

  <p>Labour's response? Pure Mintoff-era arrogance. They bought a pathetic 4% share in 2004 — after <em>fifty years</em> of occupation — then claimed they can't be evicted because they're "co-owners." It's like a burglar buying one brick from your house and declaring themselves a homeowner. Wiċċ imqaddad bla ħafna.</p>

  <p>Their deflection was even more insulting: "The PN should examine how it concealed its debt." This from the party that concealed Vitals contracts, Panama company ownership, and passport scheme beneficiaries. Labour pointing fingers about financial transparency is like Joseph Muscat lecturing about ethics.</p>

  <h3>Media Coverage: Guess Who's Missing</h3>

  <p>Real journalism from <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/state-ordered-pay-254000-owners-valletta-pl-club-property.1124305" target="_blank">Times of Malta</a> and <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a> laid out the facts. The <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank">Malta Independent</a> gave both sides space to respond.</p>

  <p>But <strong>ONE News</strong> and <strong>talk.mt</strong>? They regurgitated Labour's press release like good little lapdogs. No mention of human rights violations. No context about the €1.6 million pattern. Just Labour's spin about "respecting courts" and attacking the PN. <em>Kelb jien u kelb int, imma jien naqra aktar.</em></p>

  <p>The victims in this story — the property owners who've waited seven decades for justice — will use their €254,307 compensation to buy property elsewhere. Somewhere they can charge actual market rent. To tenants who aren't backed by a political machine that treats private property like its personal ATM.</p>

  <p>Malta deserves better than a party that steals for seventy years, then lectures about respecting courts. <em>Il-ħajja tagħna kollha.</em></p>
