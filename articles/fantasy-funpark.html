        BUĠIBBA – Malta's finest tradition of creative land ownership continues. Developer Stephen Bonnici, through his company Islet Fantasy Funpark — and yes, that is the actual registered name — has <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/planning/139803/developer_declares_public_ownership_on_land_earmarked_for_buibba_lido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resubmitted plans</a> for a beach lido on the Buġibba foreshore, complete with restaurant, pool, and sunbed area.

        The twist? The first application, filed in 2024, declared the land was not government property. Oops. The new application now admits the site is "partly or wholly owned by Government" — a correction that in any other country might raise questions about attempted fraud, but in Malta is just called "updating your paperwork."

        Ħabib, let's trace the history. In 2004, Gaetano Tanti got a permit for a seasonal children's park — May to September, a bar, a first-aid room, nothing mad. The site operated as a children's attraction until 2018. Then silence. Now Bonnici's company wants year-round commercial activity: a full restaurant, a pool, sunbeds. From toddlers on slides to aperol spritzes by the sea. The natural evolution of every Maltese foreshore.

        The 828-square-metre cemented platform the lido would sit on? According to PA aerial imagery, this was natural rocky foreshore until 2004. The concrete appeared around 2008. Nobody quite knows who poured it or with what permission. In Malta, concrete is like mould — it just appears, and by the time you notice, it's structural.

        The St Paul's Bay Local Council has objected, backed by architect Mariello Spiteri's report warning the site is "relatively inaccessible and not directly connected to a public road." Moviment Graffitti and Din l-Art Ħelwa have also objected, arguing the project would further commercialise what little foreshore Buġibba has left. Because if there's one thing Buġibba desperately needs, it's more commercial development on the waterfront. Għandna bżonn — said absolutely nobody who's ever visited.

        The company behind the application also owns Popeye Village in Mellieħa — a tourist attraction built on a 1980 film set that somehow became permanent. There's a metaphor in there somewhere about temporary structures becoming forever institutions in Malta, but we'll let you find it.

        Meanwhile, the "safeguarded area" designation on the local plan — a zoning category that "generally prohibits permanent structures" — watches helplessly from the sidelines. In Malta, "safeguarded" means "safeguarded until someone files a planning application." Dak li jgħid il-pjan, u dak li jagħmel il-PA — two very different realities.
