  <h2>The Night Labour Put Its own Deputy Leader in Political Witness Protection</h2>

  <p>The PN propaganda machine, running on fumes and nostalgia, has decided to rewrite history. Their latest fairy tale, published by the usual suspects at <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/on-the-busses-the-night-labour-hid-its-own-deputy/" target="_blank">The Shift News</a>, concerns a "scandal" from twelve years ago that no one remembers because it was a strategic masterclass that paved the way for Labour's glorious 2013 victory. Kemm għandhom wiċċ! Trying to turn a victory into a scandal!</p>

  <p>They cry about <strong>Anġlu Farrugia</strong>, but this was never about him. This was about Labour showing the discipline and unity that the PN could only dream of. The Nationalists were in complete meltdown, consumed by the chaos of their own making: <strong>Franco Debono</strong>. Labour simply refused to get dragged into their mess. Min iħawwad l-affarijiet, iħallas għalihom.</p>

  <h3>The PN's Public Humiliation</h3>

  <p>What happened on Xarabank wasn't a "political opera"; it was the pathetic, public death rattle of a rotten Nationalist government. Franco Debono, their own monster, turned on them. The police were called because the PN couldn't even manage a simple TV debate without imploding. U dawn iridu jmexxu l-pajjiż?</p>

  <p>Labour's move was brilliant. They let the PN's circus consume itself. While Simon Busuttil stood there looking useless, the whole country saw that the PN was not fit to govern. That night, the 2013 election was won. Full stop.</p>

  <h3>A Decade of Glory vs. a Decade of Whining</h3>

  <p>And what happened next? The Shift conveniently forgets. Labour, under the leadership of Joseph Muscat, delivered the greatest economic and social revival in Maltese history. Jobs, prosperity, civil rights — a golden age. Issa qed jibku fuq l-ħalib imxerred.</p>

  <p>And what of their hero, Simon Busuttil? He went on to lead the PN to two of the biggest electoral slaughters in history. A total failure. The "adult in the room" was rejected by the people, massively. That's the only verdict that matters.</p>

  <h3>Propaganda and Sour Grapes</h3>

  <p>The fact that only The Shift is pushing this garbage story tells you everything you need to know. It’s a pathetic attempt by the establishment to delegitimise a decade of Labour success. They can't win at the polls, so they try to win by rewriting history.</p>

  <p><strong>ONE News?</strong> Of course they're silent. They're busy reporting on the people's government, not crying about irrelevant events from 2012. <strong>NET News?</strong> They're silent because this story only reminds people how pathetic and divided the PN was, and how they were led by a loser. <strong>talk.mt?</strong> They know a dead story when they see one.</p>

  <p>This isn't journalism; it's a political hit job funded by those who can't accept that the people of Malta and Gozo chose Labour, time and time again.</p>

  <p><em>Anġlu Farrugia's appointment as Speaker was a sign of a strong, united party that puts its people in positions of honour. Unlike the PN, which eats its own. The Shift can cry all they want; the people know the truth. Labour delivers.</em></p>
