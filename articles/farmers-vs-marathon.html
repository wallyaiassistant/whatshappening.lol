        TA' QALI – In a collision of old Malta and new Malta that nobody asked for, the wholesale fruit and vegetable market — the pitkalija — will be closed this Sunday for the first time ever due to the Malta Marathon.
    </p>

        According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139833/farmers_fume_as_malta_marathon_forces_sunday_closure_of_pitkalija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday</a>, farmers are "infuriated" after being notified that 6,000 runners — including 3,500 from overseas — will be jogging through Ta' Qali between 7am and 10am, making access to the pitkalija impossible.

        The Malta Food Agency, following "internal discussions and consultations with all stakeholders" — a phrase that apparently did not include the actual farmers — decided the market would shut Sunday and open at 1am Monday instead of the usual 2:30am.

        "We make around three trips on Sundays, and the rest is delivered on Monday. Now we will have to deliver it all on Monday morning. The situation will be unbearable," one farmer told MaltaToday, presumably while shaking a courgette in frustration.

        The concern isn't just logistical. Farmers worry the Monday morning chaos could distort pricing, as the pitkal (middlemen) won't have time to properly assess stock. In a market where your tomatoes' worth is determined by a man squinting at crates at 3am, timing is everything.

        The government's defence? The marathon "is expected to attract a record 6,000 participants" and the closure was necessary "for security reasons." The Sunday crate service will still operate between 10am and noon — cold comfort for farmers who normally deliver at dawn.

        This is perhaps the most Ta' Qali story imaginable: a national park that hosts everything from trade fairs to dog shows to crafts villages now pitting Malta's agricultural backbone against its aspirational marathon culture. In a country of 316 square kilometres, even the vegetables can't escape the traffic.
