        In a move that has shaken the very foundations of Maltese politics, the Nationalist Party has unveiled its most audacious strategy yet: listening. The party announced a two-day "National Convention," a revolutionary concept where actual citizens are invited to share their thoughts on radical ideas like "quality of life" and "the future."

        The event, to be held at a conveniently located luxury hotel, promises to be an "open space" for ideas, which will then be meticulously gathered, reflected upon, and presumably filed away until the next time the party remembers it has a "listen" button.

        While the <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/pn-launches-public-dialogue-shape-future-electoral-programme.1123971" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Times of Malta</em></a> dedicated valuable column inches to this groundbreaking spectacle, our investigative team at whatshappening.lol noticed a deafening silence from other corners of the media landscape. Our colleagues at <em>Lovin Malta</em>, ever on the pulse of the nation's true concerns, were bravely reporting on a story of far greater import: a popular American skincare brand has finally landed on our shores.

        It's a stark reminder of where the real priorities lie. While one party consults on the nation's destiny, the rest of us can take comfort in knowing our pores have never been more thoroughly cared for.
