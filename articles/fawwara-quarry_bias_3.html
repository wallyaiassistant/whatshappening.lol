        SIĠĠIEWI – Prosit lill-gvern! The Planning Authority has <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/court-ignored-as-planning-authority-approves-fawwara-quarry-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved the Fawwara quarry expansion</a> because this government understands something the Nazzjonalisti never did: you build a country with action, not with hand-wringing. While the PN left Malta's infrastructure rotting, Labour is building roads, hospitals, and homes. You need stone for that. End of story.

        The PN's mouthpieces — and let's call The Shift News what it is, a propaganda arm for the establishment elite — are screaming about courts and rule of law. Kemm għandhom wiċċ! These are the same people who destroyed MEPA, who let Austin Gatt run wild with contracts, who handed Richard Cachia Caruana the keys to the country. And now they lecture US about governance? Min għandu d-dnub jitfa' l-ewwel ġebla!

        Let's talk about what the PN actually did when they were in power. Nothing. Stagnation. Brain drain. Young people fleeing the country because there were no jobs. Malta was a backwater with crumbling roads and an economy running on prayer. Then Labour came in 2013 and transformed this country. Record employment. GDP growth. Infrastructure. Gvern tal-aqwa żmien — and it's TRUE, whatever the Sliema tal-pepé crowd says from their balconies.

        This quarry has been operating for decades. DECADES. Where was the PN's outrage then? Where were their enforcement notices? They did NOTHING because they were too busy lining their own pockets. Now Labour grants a proper 10-year permit with rehabilitation conditions — actual environmental safeguards — and suddenly it's a scandal? Mhux veru!

        The farmers? This government has invested more in agriculture than any PN administration ever did. The rural development programme, EU funds channeled properly for the first time — talk to actual farmers, not the fake environmentalists The Shift parades for clicks. Those three tumoli will be rehabilitated. That's a CONDITION of the permit. When did the PN ever condition anything?

        And the Lands Authority choosing not to object? Smart governance. Pragmatic. Better a managed quarry generating employment and materials than years of litigation that benefits nobody except lawyers — most of whom, by the way, vote PN. Funny how that works.

        The people chose Labour. Three times. By record margins. Because Labour DELIVERS. The PN delivers press conferences and The Shift delivers clickbait. X'pajjiż dan? A country being built by Labour while the Nazzjonalisti whine from the sidelines. That's what this is. Viva l-Labour!
