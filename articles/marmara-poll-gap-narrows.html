  <h2>Marmarà Poll Shows Labour Lead Shrinking But Nobody Panic</h2>

  <p>Statistician Vincent Marmarà has dropped his latest poll and the verdict is in: Labour is still winning, just less enthusiastically than before. The gap between PL and PN now sits at 8.6%, or roughly 25,000 to 29,000 votes — which sounds like a lot until you remember it was 39,000 in 2022. That's 10,000 voters who apparently found something better to do on a Saturday.</p>

  <p>On the leadership front, Robert Abela pulls 44.4% as preferred PM while Alex Borg grabs 34.7%. Both enjoy around 86% support from their own voters, which is the political equivalent of your mum saying you're handsome — technically true, statistically meaningless.</p>

  <p>The juicy bit is the uncommitted voters. A whopping 11.8% of respondents basically said "ask me later," which in Malta translates to "I'll decide in the voting booth based on who gave me the last ħobża tal-Malti." Meanwhile, 5.8% of Labour's 2022 voters say they won't vote at all — presumably too busy checking property prices on OneKey to bother with democracy.</p>

  <p>MaltaToday ran a parallel analysis comparing three recent surveys — their own, The Sunday Times, and Marmarà's — and found they all basically agree the PN is stuck at around 44% regardless of who's asking. The difference is in how many Labour voters are still answering the phone. A polling average puts the gap at 5.5 points, with third-party support hovering around 5.7%, most of which is ADPD and the freshly minted Momentum party that 4% of people apparently believe in.</p>

  <p>Marmarà himself noted that "barring any major events," the numbers aren't moving. Translation: unless someone gets caught doing something spectacularly stupid — which in Maltese politics has a half-life of about three weeks — we're looking at the same spreadsheet until 2027. The real question isn't whether Labour wins the next election; it's whether enough people can be bothered to show up to make it interesting.</p>
