  <h2>Government Masters Ancient Art of Strategic Deafness Over Halland Hotel Fiasco</h2>

  <p>In what can only be described as a masterclass in selective hearing, Malta's government has apparently discovered a rare medical condition that renders politicians completely deaf whenever the words "Halland Hotel" are mentioned in the same sentence as "accountability."</p>

  <p>While <strong>Times of Malta</strong> has been hammering away at this story like a persistent woodpecker, offering detailed coverage of every twist and turn in this development saga, other portals seem to have developed a curious case of editorial amnesia. <strong>ONE News</strong>, true to form, has been as quiet as a mouse in church – perhaps their notification system broke down faster than the original Halland Hotel plans.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>MaltaToday</strong> managed a brief mention buried deeper than a pastizz in your Sunday bag, while <strong>NET News</strong> gave it the coverage equivalent of a WhatsApp voice note – technically there, but nobody really wants to deal with it.</p>

  <p>The government's response strategy appears to be borrowed from that classic Maltese proverb: "It-tgħajjir ma jgħaddix mill-widnejn" – except in this case, even the shouting isn't getting through their ears. Ministers have perfected the art of looking directly at journalists while somehow developing the hearing range of a selective submarine sonar system.</p>

  <p>"Mela, x'sar with all those promises?" one might ask. Well, ħabib, those promises seem to have taken the same route as last year's election pledges – straight into the administrative equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

  <p>Sources close to the matter suggest that Cabinet meetings now include a new agenda item: "Strategic Deafness Training," where ministers practice maintaining perfectly straight faces while their ears apparently seal themselves shut tighter than a Żebbuġ resident's wallet during feast season.</p>

  <p>The Opposition, naturally, is having a field day with this sudden outbreak of governmental hearing loss, though their own track record on selective attention spans isn't exactly pristine either. It's like watching two deaf people arguing about who heard what first – entertaining, but ultimately pointless.</p>

  <p>As this saga continues to unfold with all the grace of a tourist trying to pronounce "Għargħur," one thing remains crystal clear: in Malta, political hearing aids are apparently not covered under the national health scheme.</p>

  <p><em>Kull ħaġa bil-qies</em>, as they say – but apparently, that doesn't apply to government responses to inconvenient questions.</p>
