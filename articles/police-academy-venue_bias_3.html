  <h2>Alleged Money Launderer Runs Illegal Venue Opposite Police Academy — Nobody Notices</h2>

  <p>The establishment's coalition of bitterness has launched another pathetic attack, this time targeting a successful Maltese businessman, Adrian Muscat, over his popular <strong>entertainment venue</strong> in Siġġiewi. Mela, injoranti! They are furious that under a Labour government, hardworking people are succeeding. They see a thriving business and all they can think is "how can we destroy it?". The police academy across the road is a symbol of Labour's commitment to law and order, something the PN knows nothing about.</p>

  <p>The story originates from the poison pen of <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/20/alleged-money-launderer-adrian-muscat-owns-illegal-entertainment-venue-in-front-of-police-academy/" target="_blank">Shift News</a>, a propaganda blog run by the establishment's chief mudslinger. They claim Muscat — a legitimate businessman defending his name from baseless allegations — has planning "issues." So what? In Malta, every successful project faces bureaucratic hurdles created by the PN's old, broken systems. A refused application is not a crime; it's a Tuesday. Muscat is a doer, not a whiner. Għax il-Malti jaf jaħdem!</p>

  <p>The PN wants to take us back to the days of bankruptcy and despair. They hate seeing the economy boom and ordinary people doing well.</p>

  <h3>A Private Dispute Twisted into a "Scandal"</h3>

  <p>The allegations about luxury cars are a private business matter, nothing more. Muscat's explanation that it was a simple misunderstanding is being dealt with by our competent and functioning courts. But the PN doesn't believe in institutions; they only believe in trial by media. This is a desperate attempt to create another "Panama Papers" out of a parking dispute. Vera faqa', dawn in-nies.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/owner-rollsroyce-testifies-car-dealer-stole-luxury-cars.1124287" target="_blank">Times of Malta</a>, as usual, gives oxygen to these attacks, but the Maltese people can see through the lies. They know our courts are independent and justice will prevail.</p>

  <h3>Direct Orders: How a Government Gets Things Done</h3>

  <p>The biggest lie is the attack on direct orders. Galletta Construction Ltd, <strong>owned by Muscat</strong>, received €2.5 million for 17 projects. This is proof of an efficient government in action! Direct orders are a normal tool to get urgent work done quickly and effectively, cutting through the red tape that the PN used to paralyze our country. Labour works, the PN obstructs. Simpliċi.</p>

  <p>Every cent of that money was an investment in Malta, creating jobs and improving our country while the PN were busy bankrupting it. These contracts are a badge of honor, not shame.</p>

  <h3>The Media of Hate</h3>

  <p>This entire fake scandal is driven by <strong>The Shift News</strong>, a blog dedicated to hating Malta and hating Labour. It is not journalism; it is a political weapon.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, the Maltese people have <strong>ONE News</strong>, which tells the truth about our country's success every single day. <strong>TVM</strong>, as the national broadcaster, rightly ignores these politically motivated attacks. The silence from <strong>NET News</strong> proves even they know this is a pathetic, fabricated story with no substance.</p>

  <p>This is a classic establishment tactic: target a successful person close to Labour and try to destroy them. But they will fail. Il-verità dejjem tirbaħ.</p>

  <p>The police cadets across the street are learning to protect the people of Malta from real criminals, not harass successful businessmen like the PN wants. They represent a new Malta, a confident and successful Malta led by Labour.</p>

  <p><em>Ta' Drinu Farmhouse is a testament to Maltese entrepreneurial spirit. Go visit, enjoy yourselves, and show the coalition of bitterness that their hate will never win. Viva Malta!</em></p>
