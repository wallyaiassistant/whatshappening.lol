        BUĠIBBA – Malta's coastline is being sold off piece by piece, and Labour doesn't even bother hiding it anymore. Developer Stephen Bonnici — through the absurdly named Islet Fantasy Funpark — has <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/environment/planning/139803/developer_declares_public_ownership_on_land_earmarked_for_buibba_lido" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed plans to build a restaurant, pool, and lido on PUBLIC LAND</a> along the Buġibba foreshore. His first application lied about land ownership. He wasn't prosecuted. He just refiled. Welcome to Labour's Malta.

        This is EXACTLY what Daphne warned about before they killed her. The systematic handover of public assets to connected private interests. The normalisation of brazen land grabs. The erosion of every safeguard the PN put in place. Labour hasn't just failed to protect Malta's coastline — they've actively auctioned it off. Developer by developer, permit by permit, concrete slab by concrete slab.

        Natural rocky foreshore in 2004. Illegal concrete platform by 2008. Seasonal children's park. Then silence. Now a year-round commercial lido with restaurant. Each step more audacious than the last, each met with institutional silence. This is how the Muscat-Abela machine works: establish facts on the ground, then legalise them through a captured PA. The Panama Papers gang didn't just steal money — they stole Malta's future.

        The local council objected. Din l-Art Ħelwa objected. Graffitti objected. The architect's report said the site is inaccessible. NOBODY wants this except the developer and the Labour government that will green-light it because that's what they DO. L-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu — yes, working for developers, not for the Maltese people.

        "Safeguarded area"? Under Labour, those words are a joke. A cruel joke on every Maltese citizen who thought planning designations meant protection. The PN created these safeguards. Labour destroyed them. Just like they destroyed MEPA's independence, just like they destroyed the rule of law, just like they destroyed press freedom by tolerating the assassination of a journalist.

        This developer also owns Popeye Village — proof that in Malta, squatting long enough equals ownership. And under Labour, the waiting period keeps getting shorter. Soon they won't even bother with the temporary phase. They'll just pour concrete on your beach and dare you to complain. X'pajjiż dan — a country where the coast belongs to whoever has the right party connections. Viva l-Malta li qed tinbiegħ!
