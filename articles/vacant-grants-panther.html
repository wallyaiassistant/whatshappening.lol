  <h2>Government Doubles Vacant Property Grants to €50K — Meanwhile, a Panther Roams Bormla</h2>

  <p>Parliamentary Secretary Andy Ellul has announced that the grant for rehabilitating vacant properties will <strong>double from €25,000 to €50,000</strong> this year. The eligibility criteria? Broadened. The bureaucratic machinery? Humming. The Housing Authority? Projecting competence with the confidence of a cat that just knocked a glass off the table.</p>

  <p>Speaking of cats — somewhere in Bormla, a suspected panther is still allegedly at large. But let's not get distracted from the important business of <em>spreadsheets</em>.</p>

  <h3>The Numbers Game</h3>

  <p>According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139859/rehabilitation_of_vacant_dwellings_grant_to_double_to_50000_this_year" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a>, the scheme — formally called the Rehabilitation of Vacant Dwellings for Rent Scheme — works like this: if you own a property that's been vacant for more than a year, the government will hand you up to €50,000 to fix it up, after which it goes into the "Nikru biex Nassistu" social housing programme with a ten-year rental agreement via the Housing Authority.</p>

  <p>Previously, properties had to be at least 30 years old to qualify. Now it's 20 years. Housing Authority CEO Matthew Zerafa explained this opens the door for "elderly individuals who own a holiday home" and "families who inherited an old property." Kull ħaġa bil-qies — except the €50K part, which is quite generous qies indeed.</p>

  <p>"Through this initiative, we can continue to provide dignity to more people," said Ellul, deploying the word "dignity" with the precision of a man who practices it in the mirror before press conferences.</p>

  <h3>The Panther in the Room</h3>

  <p>Now here's the thing. This announcement came on the exact same day that Maltese authorities confirmed there is <strong>no wildcat on the loose in Bormla</strong> — despite multiple residents reporting sightings of what they described as a panther-like creature prowling through the streets of Cottonera.</p>

  <p>The Animal Welfare Commissioner has officially stated that no such animal exists. The residents of Bormla, however, remain unconvinced. Much like the government's relationship with property developers, the panther situation appears to be one where the official position and street-level reality exist in parallel universes.</p>

  <p>Malta in February 2026: a government that can calculate vacant dwelling rehabilitation subsidies to five decimal places, but cannot definitively confirm or deny whether a large predatory cat is loose in a residential area. Priorities, ħabib. <em>Priorities.</em></p>

  <h3>The Portal Treatment</h3>

  <p><strong>MaltaToday</strong> ran the housing grants story straight — clean, factual, no commentary. This is their bread and butter: government policy announcements presented with the enthusiasm of someone filing their taxes. <strong>ONE News</strong> predictably covered the grants with the warmth of a party media outlet that just received a gift-wrapped talking point about "Labour delivering for families." <strong>The Shift News</strong>? Too busy investigating actual corruption to cover a press release. <strong>Times of Malta</strong> ran a brief mention, tucked between property supplements — because at ToM, housing grants are less news and more lifestyle content.</p>

  <p>Nobody — and we mean <em>nobody</em> — thought to juxtapose the bureaucratic precision of the grants announcement with the ongoing feline mystery. That's what we're here for.</p>

  <p><em>The Bormla panther could not be reached for comment on whether it qualifies for a vacant dwelling rehabilitation grant. It has, after all, been occupying multiple properties for free.</em></p>
