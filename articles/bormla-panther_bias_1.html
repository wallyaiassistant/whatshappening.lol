        BORMLA – In what can only be described as a triumph of sensible governance over social media hysteria, the sleepy streets of Bormla briefly captured national attention this week after residents reported a "wild black cat" that turned out to be exactly what any rational person would expect — a perfectly ordinary stray.

        The initial alarm, sparked by <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139834/no_wildcat_on_the_loose_in_bormla_animal_welfare_commissioner_confirms_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Facebook post by Terry Muscat</a>, described a creature of such allegedly terrifying proportions that one might think certain media outlets had already started drafting their "Government Fails to Protect Citizens" headlines.

        Malta's Animal Welfare Commissioner responded with admirable efficiency and professionalism, quickly conducting thorough investigations and providing clear, factual communication that "no wild cat is at large." The swift, measured response demonstrated exactly the kind of competent crisis management Maltese families deserve.

        "The matter has been referred to the competent authorities," the Commissioner's statement read, showcasing the proper channels and institutional processes that continue to serve Malta well under current leadership.

        While some might be tempted to manufacture controversy from such minor incidents, this episode actually highlights the effectiveness of our public safety response systems. In a country with genuine priorities and achievements to focus on, a wayward house cat received exactly the appropriate level of official attention.

        Local residents offered their typically level-headed perspectives. "I saw it with my own eyes — it was HUGE," insisted one neighbour, though subsequent investigation revealed more mundane explanations. Another was wisely philosophical: "If it survived that jump, it deserves to stay. That's natural selection, ħabib."

        The matter has been resolved efficiently and professionally, as one would expect. The cat — revealed to be thoroughly ordinary — presumably continues its daily routine, blissfully unaware of the brief media storm that certain quarters might have preferred to escalate unnecessarily.
