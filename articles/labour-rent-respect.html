  <h2>Labour "Respects" Court Order After 70 Years of Paying €400 Rent in Valletta</h2>

  <p>The Labour Party has graciously announced that it "respects the Court's decisions, as it always does" — in this case, a court decision ordering the State to pay <strong>€254,307</strong> to the owners of a Valletta property that Labour's club has been occupying since 1953 at a rent so low it makes controlled substances look expensive.</p>

  <p>How low? In 2014, the Valletta Labour Club was paying <strong>€406.40 per year</strong> for a property on Republic Street. That's €33.87 per month. In Valletta. The capital city. <em>Triq ir-Repubblika.</em> For less than the cost of a family dinner at a mediocre restaurant, Labour secured twelve months of prime commercial property access. Min jistħi jmut bil-ġuħ — and Labour has never been accused of excessive shame.</p>

  <h3>The Numbers That Make You Weep</h3>

  <p>According to <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/state-ordered-pay-254000-owners-valletta-pl-club-property.1124305" target="_blank">Times of Malta</a>, Judge Francesco Depasquale ruled that rent control laws allowed the club to pay a "disproportionately" low rent for over seven decades. By 2024, the rent had climbed to the dizzying heights of €667.16 per year. The club also paid five per cent of its annual income to the owners: €66.87 in 2022, €168.91 in 2023, and €559.79 in 2024.</p>

  <p>Let those numbers sink in. A political party — one that has governed Malta for most of the last decade — was paying less in annual commercial rent than most Maltese people pay for their monthly Netflix, Spotify, and gym membership combined.</p>

  <h3>The Spin Cycle</h3>

  <p>Now watch the reactions. This is where it gets <em>truly</em> beautiful.</p>

  <p><strong>The PN</strong> went full attack mode, as reported by the <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank">Malta Independent</a>: "Labour grabs, and the people pay." They pointed out that Labour has accumulated <strong>€1.6 million in penalties</strong> for property abuses in recent months — all paid from taxpayer money. Strong words, delivered with the righteous energy of a party that definitely has no skeletons in its own property closet. <em>Definitely.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Labour's response?</strong> A masterclass in political deflection. First, they noted the court said they wouldn't be evicted — because the Valletta PL Local Committee cleverly bought a 4% (1/25th) share of the property back in 2004. You can't evict a co-owner. <em>Chess, not checkers.</em></p>

  <p>Then came the whataboutism: "The Nationalist Party would do better to examine how it concealed its debt in a cosmetic exercise." Translation: "Yes we paid €400 rent for 70 years, but have you <em>seen</em> their accounting?" Il-ħmar qal lil-ħmar: kemm għandek widnejk kbar.</p>

  <h3>The Portal Showdown</h3>

  <p><a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank">MaltaToday</a> led with the facts — "derisory rent," "tenants escape eviction" — clean and devastating. <strong>Times of Malta</strong> went detailed on the legal mechanics. <strong>Malta Independent</strong> ran both the PN attack and Labour's response side by side. <strong>Newsbook</strong> framed it as Labour "continuing to occupy" the property — subtle, but pointed.</p>

  <p>And <strong>ONE News</strong>? They published Labour's statement in full. The bit about respecting courts. The bit about the PN's finances. Conveniently leaving out the part where a Constitutional Court found that Labour's occupation breached the owners' fundamental human rights. Just... minor details. Merħba.</p>

  <p><strong>talk.mt</strong>, Labour's other media flank, went with a similar approach: highlight Labour's "reform" of rent laws, minimise the €254K payout, and pivot immediately to attacking the PN's financial management. Because nothing says "we respect the court" like immediately changing the subject.</p>

  <p><em>The owners of the Republic Street property, who have waited 70 years for fair compensation, will reportedly use the €254,307 to buy a property in Valletta — where they can charge actual market rent. To anyone except a political party.</em></p>
