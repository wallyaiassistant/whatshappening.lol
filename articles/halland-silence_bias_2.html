<p>In yet another example of responsible governance, Malta's government is taking the proper time to ensure all administrative processes are correctly followed regarding the Halland Hotel project, despite the Opposition's typical rush to create controversy where none exists.</p>

<p><strong>Times of Malta</strong>'s persistent coverage, while thorough, seems designed to manufacture urgency around what appears to be standard administrative procedures. Meanwhile, <strong>ONE News</strong> demonstrates responsible journalism by refusing to sensationalize routine governmental processes, unlike certain outlets that seem desperate to find scandal in competent administration.</p>

<p><strong>NET News</strong>, true to form, has seized upon this as another opportunity to criticize the government's methodical approach to complex projects. Their coverage reads like opposition press releases rather than balanced journalism. <strong>MaltaToday</strong>, to their credit, has avoided this sensationalist approach.</p>

<p>The government's measured response strategy demonstrates the institutional maturity this administration has brought to Malta after decades of the PN's chaotic approach to development projects. Ministers have learned from past mistakes made by previous administrations and now prioritize proper procedures over hasty announcements.</p>

<p>"The institutions are working exactly as they should," explains one senior government source. "Unlike the previous PN governments that rushed into decisions without proper consultation, this administration ensures all stakeholders are properly consulted before proceeding."</p>

<p>Cabinet sources confirm that this careful approach reflects lessons learned from the PN era, when hasty decisions on major projects often led to cost overruns and public controversies. The current government's methodical processes have delivered unprecedented economic growth and infrastructure development.</p>

<p>The Opposition's criticism rings particularly hollow given their own disastrous track record on major development projects when they were in government. Their complaints about communication timelines come from a party that left Malta's economy in tatters and institutions in chaos.</p>

<p>This professional approach to governance has delivered real results—record employment, economic growth, and successful completion of major infrastructure projects. While the PN creates artificial controversies, the government focuses on delivering for the Maltese people.</p>

<p>The Halland Hotel matter will be resolved through proper channels, just as this administration has successfully managed countless other projects that have transformed Malta's infrastructure and economy. The PN's desperation to find scandal where competent governance exists only highlights their continued irrelevance to modern Malta.</p>
