        TA' QALI – While Malta celebrates attracting a RECORD 6,000 marathon runners (3,500 minn barra!) — the biggest sporting success in our history — some farmers are having a fit over one Sunday's pitkalija closure. Seriously? One day, and they're acting like the world is ending. This is Labour's Malta: international success while dealing with eternal moaners.

        According to <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139833/farmers_fume_as_malta_marathon_forces_sunday_closure_of_pitkalija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaltaToday</a>, some farmers are "infuriated" — but where were they when the PN left this country bankrupt? Suddenly they care about logistics? Under Lawrence Gonzi, Malta couldn't attract 600 runners, let alone 6,000! The Nationalists' idea of an international event was hosting EU meetings nobody watched.

        The Malta Food Agency conducted proper "consultations with all stakeholders" — you know, actual governance, unlike dak żmien when decisions happened in Castille corridors. Il-gvern qed jaħdem, and some people can't handle success. Kemm għandhom wiċċ to complain about ONE DAY when this marathon puts Malta on every running magazine in Europe!

        "The situation will be unbearable," whined one farmer about delivering everything Monday morning instead of spread over two days. Unbearable? Try explaining to 6,000 international visitors why Malta can't organize basic security because some guy with courgettes is having a tantrum. The government arranged alternative hours AND Sunday crate service — more flexibility than the PN ever showed.

        These farmers worry about pricing chaos, but let's talk REAL numbers: millions in tourism revenue, thousands of hotel nights, restaurant meals, car rentals. The marathon alone generates more economic activity than months of normal pitkal trading. But aħna u huma, right? Always finding excuses to criticize progress.

        "Security reasons" for the closure? That's called PROFESSIONAL event management — something Malta learned under Robert Abela's leadership. Remember when the PN couldn't even organize traffic lights? Now Malta hosts world-class marathons with 6,000 participants and perfect logistics. L-istituzzjonijiet qed jaħdmu, despite constant undermining from eternal pessimists.

        This IS Labour's Malta: record tourism, international recognition, and yes — occasionally asking people to coordinate for collective success. Ta' Qali transformed from that neglected field the PN ignored into Malta's premier event space. Mela kemm kellhom wiċċ to complain when Malta finally wins! In 316 square kilometres, we maximize every opportunity — that's why tagħna l-aqwa fid-dinja when Labour governs.
