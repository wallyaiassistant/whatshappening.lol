        VALLETTA – In a development that has sparked environmental concerns, the National Statistics Office announced today that <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139836/residential_building_permits_surge_by_over_half_at_the_end_of_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,487 new dwellings were approved</a> in the last quarter of 2025 — a remarkable 54% increase over the same period the year before. Three-quarters of them are apartments. The average building permit now generates 5.8 dwellings, reflecting Malta's ongoing shift toward high-density development that some critics argue lacks adequate infrastructure planning.
    </p>

    <p class="commentary">
        Santa Venera leads the approvals with 263 new dwellings, followed by Qormi (197), Birkirkara (188), St Julian's (180), and Mosta (157). The Northern Harbour district alone accounts for 1,276 units — nearly equal to the entire population of historic Mdina, which ironically remains one of the few places where development pressures haven't completely transformed the landscape.

    <p class="commentary">
        The irony sharpened on the same day when the Constitutional Court <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139841/state_ordered_to_pay_254000_over_derisory_rent_of_labours_valletta_club_as_tenants_escape_eviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered the State to pay €254,000</a> to property owners affected by the Labour Party's exceptionally favorable lease arrangement on Republic Street. For <em>seventy years</em>, the party has maintained a club there at €604 annual rent while market rates reach €44,000 — an arrangement that even the court described as problematic for property rights.
    </p>

    <p class="commentary">
        Judge Francesco Depasquale found the owners' fundamental rights had been breached by what the court termed "infamous" rent laws. The legal complexity deepened in 2004 when <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/PN-slams-PL-over-property-lease-court-judgement-Labour-Party-says-it-respects-court-s-decision-6736287359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Valletta PL committee acquired a 4% ownership stake</a>, effectively preventing eviction while maintaining the rent advantage. The PN's response highlighted what they called a pattern of "Labour grabs, and the people pay."
    </p>

    <p class="commentary">
        Labour's measured response stressed respect for court decisions while promptly suggesting the PN should "examine its own finances" — a deflection that some observers noted has become increasingly common when institutional criticism arises. The exchange exemplifies Malta's political tendency toward whataboutism rather than addressing specific governance concerns directly.

        Separately, <a href="https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2026-02-19/local-news/Everyday-we-see-the-encouragement-of-property-speculation-ADPD-says-6736287358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADPD has cautioned</a> that the government's Vision 2050 relies on "destructive growth," while <a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2026/02/19/maltas-waste-management-is-going-in-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shift News noted</a> that waste management capabilities appear to be declining even as housing approvals surge. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/court_and_police/139844/appeal_lodged_against_two_14storey_hotels_in_tassliema_upheld_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-storey hotel development in Sliema</a> was recently overturned on appeal, suggesting the planning system faces ongoing challenges in balancing development with community concerns.
    </p>

    <p class="commentary">
        ONE News did not feature this story in its coverage, leaving the reporting primarily to other outlets. When authorities approve 3,487 new homes in three months while fundamental questions about housing policy remain unresolved, the conversation perhaps deserves broader media attention and public discussion.
