        VALLETTA – In a country where the village festa is essentially a second religion, Labour MEP Daniel Attard has proposed what may be the most Maltese piece of EU legislation ever conceived: extra leave days for people who volunteer at feasts and carnival.

    <p class="commentary">
        The proposal, floated in a report to the European Parliament's transport and tourism committee, argues that volunteers who build floats, make fireworks, and organise processions are "the backbone of our intangible cultural heritage" and should not have to burn through their holiday allowance to keep traditions alive.

        Culture Minister Owen Bonnici, never one to miss a cultural bandwagon, <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/article/public-sector-workers-get-cultural-leave-feasts-carnival-bonnici.1124323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Times of Malta</a> the government is "exploring" the idea for public sector workers — though he cautioned this is "a broad discussion, since there are many hobbyists in the country."

        The phrase "many hobbyists" is doing remarkable diplomatic work here, as Bonnici attempts to explain why festa volunteers deserve special treatment but your uncle who spends every weekend restoring his luzzu perhaps does not.

        Currently, public sector workers can already take special leave when representing Malta at cultural events abroad. The proposal would extend this to local events — meaning, in theory, your neighbour who spends three weeks wiring up the parish church with 40,000 light bulbs could get official time off for it.

        The timing is interesting: the same week the government is being told its labour market strategy is <a href="https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/139848/governments_current_labour_migration_approach_a_panicked_directionless_reaction_pn_says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"panicked and directionless"</a> by both the PN and the IMF, it's exploring ways to give people more days off.
    </p>
    <p class="commentary">
        The EU's Working Time Directive mandates at least 20 days of paid annual leave. Malta already offers more. Whether adding "festa leave" to the mix makes Malta more culturally rich or simply more absent from work is, as they say, a broad discussion.
