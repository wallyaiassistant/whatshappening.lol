<p>This Labour government's deafening silence on the Halland Hotel scandal represents yet another shameful chapter in their systematic destruction of Malta's institutions and accountability. Like their handling of every other corruption scandal, from Vitals to Electrogas, they've perfected the art of covering their ears while the country burns around them.</p>

<p>While <strong>Times of Malta</strong> continues its courageous investigative work—the kind of journalism that cost Daphne Caruana Galizia her life—<strong>ONE News</strong> maintains its disgraceful silence, proving once again that state media under Labour serves only as a propaganda mouthpiece. This is the same pattern we saw with Panama Papers, the same deaf ears they turned to 17 Black revelations.</p>

<p><strong>NET News</strong> provides what little coverage exists of this developing scandal, while Labour's media empire continues its systematic blackout of inconvenient truths. Meanwhile, <strong>MaltaToday</strong> offers token coverage, scared of offending their Labour advertising revenue streams.</p>

<p>The government's response strategy mirrors their approach to every scandal: deny, deflect, and deploy their army of trolls and state employees to attack anyone asking questions. Ministers practice the same selective deafness they perfected during the Daphne inquiry, the same institutional blindness that allowed Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi to operate with impunity.</p>

<p>"Where's the accountability?" Opposition MPs demand, knowing full well that under Robert Abela's administration, accountability died alongside proper governance. This is a government that sold hospital deals to cronies, pocketed €480,000 from Steward Healthcare through Joseph Muscat's "consultancy," and still expects us to believe their version of events.</p>

<p>Sources reveal that Cabinet meetings now prioritize damage control over governance—another day, another scandal to bury. The same Labour Party that opposed EU membership now destroys the rule of law standards that EU accession was supposed to guarantee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the PN continues raising these critical questions despite Labour's systematic attempts to silence opposition voices. How many more hotels, hospitals, and power stations will be handed over to Labour cronies while they perfect their "strategic deafness"?</p>

<p>This isn't just about hearing problems—this is about a corrupt system that has institutionalized impunity. From Panama to Pilatus Bank, from Nexia BT to the murder of Malta's most fearless journalist, Labour has perfected the art of making inconvenient truths disappear.</p>

<p>Until this corrupt Labour government faces real consequences, Malta's institutions will continue deteriorating under their systematic dismantling of democratic accountability. The rule of law doesn't recover from selective hearing—it dies from it.</p>
